5731498,29457107,2015-04-07,23095855,Paolo,"The house is beautiful, we were the first guests and everything was perfect. the house is actually a typical town center house with kind of courtyard, but more than anything else: it is in the very center of plaka, in the middle of it all.
Furniture classy design (design chairs of XX century masters) and all comforts.
George was very helpful: we needed a hair dryer and he got it to us the first day. Also very nice in arranging times of departure and baggage drop off. Really, super. Thanks"
5731498,31016835,2015-04-30,31804508,Catherine,"Magnifique maison bourgeoise au centre de Plaka, au coeur de la vieille ville et tout au pied de l'Acropole!  Un vrai bonheur, à 5 mn des principaux monuments et musées, à proximité des restaurants et des bars où l'on peut déguster un bon déjeuner grec en contemplant le Panthéon."
5731498,31974621,2015-05-12,25774985,Sam,Lovely apartment. Host was helpful. Very clean. Great location.
5731498,32256117,2015-05-16,27845791,Di,Our experience in George's house is really great. The house is in an wonderful location and the rooms are large.
5731498,32659424,2015-05-19,33411612,Antonis,"Το σπιτάκι είναι εξαιρετικό, ανακαινισμένο, φωτεινό με μικρή εσσωτερική αυλή και πάνω απ όλα σε φανταστική περιοχή. Βρίσκεται μόνο δευτερόλεπτα μακριά από το μετρό Ακρόπολης και το Μουσείο.

Ο Γιώργος απάντησε άμεσα, το σπίτι ήταν πεντακάθαρο και όλα ήταν ομαλά. Σίγουρα θα ξαναπάω! "
5731498,33153814,2015-05-25,4158744,Turid Og Erling,"The apartment had a wonderful location in Plaka and was nice, clean and spatious! We didnt meet George but he was communicating politely in messages and offered transport at reasonable prices to/from airpot/port and the apartment. Unfortunately we did not get the message about how to turn on aircondition and hot water until the second day but his helper came and fixed it."
5731498,33458512,2015-05-28,9867287,Annie,"George was a great host and very quick in communicating. He helped secure transport to the airport and his driver was very friendly and prompt. Someone met us at the apartment to show us around and give restaurant suggestions. The location of this apartment could not be better as you are right in the Plaka on a pedestrian street and within a 2 minute walk of a back (and less crowded) entrance of the Acropolis. We had so much fun exploring all of the streets of the Plaka and trying many different cafes, restaurants and bars. You have to try the Gyros in Monastiraki Square which was an excellent place to people watch.

The apartment itself was wonderful. Very spacious, full of light and had everything we needed, even a hookah! The Acropoli Metro station was maybe 2 minutes away. We took the metro from the Ferry port which was an experience for sure!
Thanks for everything George!"
5731498,33932927,2015-06-02,30841515,Tracey,"The house was wonderful - clean, well-appointed and in a great location in Plaka. Very close to the Acropolis Museum and the Acropolis itself. A bit noisy as the house is on a busy Plaka street. But this only adds to the atmosphere. We were a party of 5 and would stay here again.
My only concern is the small size of the bathroom, but this is not major. "
5731498,34258600,2015-06-06,1929948,Ben,"This apartment was great!

We didn't meet George but his employee met us at the apartment and helped us get situated. It was in the center of all the heavy tourist action (just as we hoped), clean, and looked just like it does in the photos here. All the appliances and fixtures worked well, including the hot water and shower.

One thing to keep in mind: the apartment is on the ground floor and the bedrooms look out onto a busy, touristy street. This is, in my opinion, a great feature! However, street noise might be an issue for some. It didn't bother us at all but it is worth mentioning."
5731498,34554503,2015-06-09,21784822,David,"My family of 5 had a great experience spending three nights at George's Vyronos St flat in the Plaka. Location was even better than expected in a very clean upscale pedestrian only area.
Very easy access to the Acropolis. The Acropolis was a short block or two away.
George was very responsive and easy to deal with. He arranged a reasonably priced airport transfer which was a welcome comfort after our long flight. Would definitely recommend our experience to others."
5731498,34784812,2015-06-12,32072646,Rick,Great location. Very clean. George arranged transfers from airport which was very helpful. Everything you need to see and great restaurants are all in walking distance.
5731498,35112068,2015-06-15,33278513,Mariana,"I had a wonderful stay at George's house in Plaka. The place is exactly as shown in the pictures, beautiful and impeccably clean. The house is very spacious and it's location couldn't be better. Plaka is one of the nicest neighbourhoods in Athens, with all major attractions at walking distance. George was very thoughtful and had everything organised for our late arrival (after midnight). He also gently accepted my request for a late check out. I would definitely recommend this place, not only for the amazing house but also for its thoughtful host.   "
5731498,37146146,2015-07-05,4397982,Natalia,"The apartment is located in the best imaginable spot in Athens - on a walking street in Plaka walking distance to several subway stops (Acropolis Museum is the closest - 3 min away).  It has a large beautiful yard as well.  The street stays lively during the day, but it has good windows and with the fan on, one can rest during the day. It is quiet at night. The apartment was clean and had all the modern conveniences.  It has air-conditioning in the living room and one bedroom and a fen in each.  One can leave the door of the 2nd bedroom open for air.  The only major downside is that the bathroom is outdated and small, but the location and size compensate for it.  The host was also very responsive to all communication and our needs! "
5731498,37626151,2015-07-08,40967,Erica,"George was one of the most efficient hosts I have ever encountered, and the flat in Plaka was hands-down the most beautiful apartment I saw in Athens (or practically anywhere), with huge windows and high ceilings that stream in the sun. The place was sparkling clean when we arrived, check-in was easy, and the location just could not be beat. George was super prompt with answering any questions or responding to any of our problems (even when we stupidly locked ourselves out of the house, George came to our rescue immediately!). One of the most professional and courteous Airbnb experiences I have ever had, and one of the loveliest Airbnb flats I have ever had the privilege to stay in! Thanks again~"
5731498,37754282,2015-07-10,34061966,Katie,"Location was excellent, just a couple blocks from the grande promenade and the Temple of Zeus. Apartment was clean and easy to get to."
5731498,38432199,2015-07-15,37003377,Long,"We didn't meet George but the driver check us into the apartment.  We dropped the luggage there and came back after the maid cleaned the apartment. Very nice apartment and perfect location next to Acropolis, metro, Plaka street, cool AC in living room and one bedroom. George also helped to arrange a private half day tour to Sounion and transfer back to airport. Make sure good  correspondence with George and his office upfront.  Recommended Appartment and service."
1108690,4616454,2013-05-15,6108106,Lily,"Just came back from a wonderful trip to Athens :)

The studio could not have been better located: it is in the middle of everything! Yet, I enjoyed quiet and silence when I was there: to me, it is priceless.

The place is just as described and seen in the pictures. It is therefore quite simple, but it has all the basics needed if you're just looking for a place to sleep and rest. When I arrived, everything was clean and neat and Leonidas left a plate of fruits as a welcoming gift.

Leonidas is a very kind host who made everything easy. He was waiting for me at the metro station and gave me tips. When the wifi didn't work, without even asking, he gave me a partial refund.
I only regret not to have been able to attend his concert!

Positive: the location, the host, the silence, the price.
Negative: don't expect to cook or entertain people. Only bare necessities are available. However, it is a very good for value  place!

Overall: would definitely come back :) Thank you for everything!

1108690,4693013,2013-05-20,3579072,Aimee,"Stayed for the weekend... perfect location! Close to everything... Acropolis and Parthenon within walking distance, some good restaurants on the same street and nearby.  Leon was a very good host and the studio was very clean and comfortable! Highly recommended!"
1108690,4912921,2013-06-01,3270462,Michael,"Great location, good space, very nice host and great value!"
1108690,5008305,2013-06-07,6002893,Eileen,"Leonidas was very helpful and friendly. He met us at the apartment and gave us advice as to how to find  different areas. What a great location - right next to the Acropolis!   Many wonderful places to eat near by.
"
1108690,5046380,2013-06-09,4962335,Ryan,"Perfect location, clean apartment and friendly host! Would recommend "
1108690,5073154,2013-06-10,2504555,Eleonore,"The apartment is an oasis of quiet conveniently located in the center. Leonidas is a thoughtful and friendly host.
Great experience and value."
1108690,5087730,2013-06-11,5068583,Esther,A lovely studio apartment right behind the new acropolis museum. It's a great place to stay at if you're looking for a place where you can do your sightseeing at the acropolis all day. Not to mention that the acropolis station is one stop away from the Symtanga square which makes it very convenient. Coming from the airport was hassle free! Leonidas was a great host too! :)
1108690,5215401,2013-06-18,3679396,Cécile,"Good spot to visit the acropolis and Athens ( near subway, easy to go to the airport). Leonidas is friendly and helpful.
The place to stay !"
1108690,5301921,2013-06-23,5660042,Tammy,"Convenient little flat in a great location!  Very kind, friendly host.  Only negative was confusion about check-in and dates but answered my call and was at the flat with keys in 10 minutes so no big deal.  Highly recommend!"
1108690,5399773,2013-06-28,6351267,Saphia,"Nous avons passés une nuit chez leonidas. Bien que nous soyons arrivés en avance, il était la pour nous accueillir . Le studio etait simple mais propre et comfortable. Point important, le studio est très proche du metro acropolis (pratique pour rejoindre l aeroport ) , de l'acropole et des restos , dans un quartier tranquille. Enfin, Leonidas est une personne charmante et disponible. Bref, a recommander! Merci encore Leonidas"
1108690,5512604,2013-07-03,4248460,Christopher,Nice little place next to the Acropolis museum. Very close to subway station and many interesting (tourist) spots.
1108690,5551806,2013-07-05,4524561,Christine,"Leonidas is a wonderful host, and the apartment is just perfect for a few days in Athens - centrally located (next to the Akropolis and a delicious family-run restaurant), yet really quiet and cozy. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you, Leonidas!"
1108690,5566993,2013-07-06,5594057,Molly,Leonidas's apartment is well aituated for visiting the Acropolis (right next door to the Acropolis Museum).  Excellent restaurants nearby. It is simply furnished and had everything we needed.
1108690,5610661,2013-07-08,3306430,André,Perfect location and a great host. I can definitely recommend Leonidas appartment
1108690,5783055,2013-07-16,6135302,Rachael,"I want to give a 4 1/2 star rating, this place is great for a few nights in Athens. It has all of the essentials, bed, bath room and a superb location. Leon is great, he met us at the door, helped with any information we wanted about the city and even had a few pieces of fruit for us. he gave us a heads up as well about an all publc transit shut down which luckily we were leaving Athens the day before. This flat is good for two people. The BEST location I have been for the price, only a few blocks from the main Acropoli metro stop which means right in the heart of old Athens (Acropolis, museum, Plaka and shopping district). The 1/2 star off is because of the futon bed which is not the most comfortable. I would highly recommend this flat and Athens!!"
1108690,5837814,2013-07-18,3611232,New,The apartment is located in a prime location. The neighborhood is safe at all times (day and night). All major tourist sites and restaurants are within a short walking distance from the apartment. The apartment is clean and very basic. The Internet works well. Be aware that there is no AC (I don't use one anyway) also note that the futon mattress is not so comfortable to sleep on. If the mattress was different I would give it a 10 out of 10. The host is attentive and wonderful.
1108690,5955238,2013-07-23,6990639,Greg,"This a great little apartment! It is right directly across the street from the Acropolis Museum - you couldn't get any closer.
You can cook your own food or try one of the many nearby restaurants. It is a perfect base from which to explore central Athens. "
1108690,5969621,2013-07-24,4249624,Catrin & Sebastian,"Great location for exploring all parts of Athens. Leonidas place could not be more central.The flat is just off to the Acropolis museum.The apartment itself is pretty basic, but it´s the perfect place for short stays. Besides the futon bed ( nothing for old bones and backs ;-)) I would highly recommend the appartment.  Leonidas is a very friendly and nice guy and easy to talk to. Thank you very much!"
1108690,5994695,2013-07-25,1165452,Julie,Leonidas was the perfect host. His abode is simple and that was perfect for us. He is one of the freindliest and down to earth men in Athens and is also a very well travelled one so he understands the ways and needs of fellow travellers which is to make them feel at home and he did just that. I'm sure we will see him again.
1108690,6050143,2013-07-28,4554085,Johanna,"Leon is a fantastic host, who is very concerned about the guest's comfort. The apartment is in an amazing location, and is extremely convient to the Acropolis metro, to tourist attractions, and to cafes and shops. I found the bed perfectly comfortable. It was a great pied-a-terre for me in Athens!"
1108690,6117839,2013-07-30,5210284,John,Great place. Simple but very clean and practical studio right next to the Acropolis Museum. Ideal location. Leonidas is a really nice guy and the check in was very smooth. Recommended.
1108690,6204833,2013-08-03,7610785,Stephanie,Leon was very friendly and hospitable. The place was in a great location and was just as described.
1108690,6249779,2013-08-05,6810990,Simone,"This stay again with Leonidas was very nice. I had the possibility to check in a little bit earlyer. That was very nice.
Leonidas is an friendy and helpful host. "
1108690,6304807,2013-08-07,7086094,Lena,"Leonidas is a very nice host, always quick to react to questions and interested in discussions. The apartment is simple but perfectly clean and in an amazing area in athens - check out the bakery nearby (best blueberry-muffins ever) and the openair cinema thision. Thanks for everything leonidas!"
1108690,6412857,2013-08-11,615622,Philip,Thanks! Great location and value!
1108690,6437970,2013-08-12,3196507,Aurore,Lovely flat just near the Acropolis Museum and Leonidas is very pleasant!
1108690,6488270,2013-08-14,7105080,Lea,Very good location! simple but practical.
1108690,6512919,2013-08-15,697401,Nick,"Athens was amazing and I had a great time at Leonidas flat. Definitely recommend it for a young couple or single traveling to Athens to see the major sites. Close to everything. I walked to the Acropolis (amazing), the museum, the Temple of Zeus and other cool places. You'll have a great stay. "
1108690,6532022,2013-08-16,6706665,Michael,"Leonidas' place was excellent for the price and location.  We walked all over Athens from that location.  The room is plain but clean and (as I've already noted) well located.  Leonidas was also really helpful, responsive and friendly.  We acidentally left a bag at the place after we left and he very kindly made sure we got it back before we returned home.  Great experience!  I would absolutely recommend this for a budget traveler."
1108690,6707785,2013-08-22,3774416,Charlotte,"In terms of locations, you could not ask for a better place in Athens. It is literally a stones throw away from the New Acropolis Museum. Located in an incredibly safe and quiet neighborhood, it is within walking distance of the subway, the Acropolis, and the Plaka area. Another great convenience is a Hop On, Hop Off stop across the street, as well as a fantastic restaurant next door. The flat has newly installed ac that made for much needed relief from the heat. And the apartment itself is the perfect size for 1-2 travelers. Leonidas was a gracious host, and incredibly accommodating to all of our needs. We would not hesitate to stay with him again."
1108690,6772868,2013-08-24,2449333,Alex,"Organized, gently, and generous. A very good host, in a very good district. Definitely recommended!"
1108690,6822298,2013-08-26,4972178,Alice,"Correspond exactement à la description: fonctionnel, très simple et tout proche de l'acropole. Parfait pour un jour ou deux, peut-être moins adapté pour un séjour plus long !
Tres bon accueil de Léonidas, bonne réactivité !"
1108690,6887350,2013-08-28,1739742,Stephan,"I only wish we had booked two nights instead of one, you cant find a better place for the location at a better price than this apartment, step out your door and around the corner are shops and restaurants. The acropolis is so close and the apartment itself is clean and spacious. Id stay here again in a second. Leon is a great host and was profession and punctual when meeting up to show us the place, thanks leon! And for anyone looking for a place, look no further!"
1108690,6897470,2013-08-29,7844873,Milena,"Leon, we had a great stay a your little Apartment. Everything was fine, clean and tidy. Thanks a lot! Milena and Vincent"
1108690,7001089,2013-09-02,5345902,Catherine,"Leon is a very nice person, very welcoming.

The apartement is very clean, very simply and extremly well located

Great experience"
1108690,7073858,2013-09-05,2055695,Jared,"The apartment was absolutely perfect for us. It's literally directly across the street from the Acropolis Museum (one of the best museums I've ever visted) and a 5-10 minute walk from one of the entrances to the Acropolis itself. Also a 2 minute walk from the subway. For those with lots of luggage, there are only a few stairs to climb. We were there on a 24-hour-ish hour layover. Flight got in late but Leon nicely met us at the apartment as promised. The proximity to the Acropolis also allowed us to do other things in Athen that we might now have had time to explore otherwise: like the cool area around the garment district and the plaka. Really enjoyable stay and highly recommended for anyone who wants to be literally steps from the acropolis without a high pricetag. Thanks much! "
1108690,7088359,2013-09-06,2064158,Carmen,Small and clean Apartment right in the Heart of Athens. We stayed here for one night before we went to the islands and it was fantastic! Akropolis and bars are very close... Everything in walking distance. Leonidas was very kind! Thanx a lot! This was a perfect start for our holidays!
1108690,7465228,2013-09-21,599727,Benjamin,"A comfortable apartment in front of the Acropolis Museum, at 5 minutes of the Acropolis entrance and surrounded by a few typical restaurants (an excellent one at 10 metres of the apartment!)
The host is really great and allowed us to an early check in.
We could not have found a more convenient place I guess and at a real fair price!
"
1108690,7490528,2013-09-22,7535144,Shirley,"leon is a really nice host，we arrived quite late because the flight was delayed，and made him waiting for so long，but he say nothing about this，and give us a warm welcome.
the apartment is located very close to the acropolis museum，we enjoyed staying there a lot！"
1108690,7554165,2013-09-24,8091679,Jean,"Very Good place for visiting the Acropole, the muséum and Plaka. The host is Kind, friendly & ponctual. Thank you."
1108690,7628145,2013-09-27,1631954,Adele & David,"Great location, walking distance to all the main sights and a few mins walk to the metro!
Delicious homemade authentic Greek food at To Kati Anno, a minute down the road!
The apartment was simple, clean and comfortable, but the kitchen could do with a fridge."
1108690,8080555,2013-10-15,4190705,George,"I said in apartment opposite Acropolis Museum (great price and location). BUT sofa bed VERY uncomfortable (and no good for two), bathroom needs improvement and kitchen lacks basic equipment.

Leon was friendly and came with much-needed extra towels.

Location, wifi and hot water excellent. BUT it was more comfortable on the floor than on the sofa bed."
1108690,8119857,2013-10-16,7582762,Markus,"Great appartment! I had a wonderful stay in Ektoras' and Leon's place. Everthings worked out just fine and Leon was taking care that i felt at home. He put in a new bed and an extra sofa, which made the place even more comfortable. When the bed was delivered he kept me updated about when he needed to enter the apartment so that i wouldn't be disturbed. I absolutely recommend the place and think you can't find anything better in such a perfect location!"
1108690,8162859,2013-10-18,896925,Aliki,"Very minimalist studio apartment, has what you need for short stay and is close to Acropolis, in good neighborhood, no problem walking at night.  Leon was nice, though only saw him for few seconds.  "
1108690,8281051,2013-10-23,3683085,Jessica,"we enjoyed our stay in this cute studio - it has everything, bathroom, kitchen, couch, and a NEW bed. Ah did I mention this place is across the street from the museum?!"
1108690,8412554,2013-10-29,9222200,Marie,"Very uncomplicated stay, we had everything we needed and were in the city center, around the corner from the Acropolis.
There is not really a nice view from the window and the apartment is small, but for two nights it was really nothing to complain about."
1108690,8532341,2013-11-04,4689260,Myriam,"Tiene todo lo que necesitas para unos días en Atenas. Una gran localización, junto a Plaka y a 50m de la Acrópolis.
León fue muy simpático y nos dejó todo lo necesario para nuestra estancia.
Buena relación calidad/precio, (solo le falta un poco de ventilación/luz a la habitación)"
1108690,8669992,2013-11-11,7639093,Dimitar,"Ektoras & Lion were great hosts, apartment was exactly  how it was described.
Thank you "
1108690,8733054,2013-11-14,6453294,John,"Excellent stay!  Leon was very helpful getting us settled in even though we were running a bit late to meet him, and everything was exactly as we expected.  Location was perfect, with an extremely easy walk to the Acropolis and the metro line.  Definitely a great value."
1108690,8860188,2013-11-22,1116989,Darryl,"The perfect place to stay in Athens - affordable, well located, very clean and with a great host! Highly recommended.  "
1108690,8929943,2013-11-26,6420530,Evelina,"It was a very nice experience. Flat is in a great location, easy to find and lovely to stay at. The host was real friendly and helpful. Thank you so very much!"
1108690,9182176,2013-12-11,1654599,Penny,"Excellent place to stay ,so central and within easy reach of cafes,internet cafe,(the flat has its own wi fi)there is even a launderette around the corner plus fresh veg shop and wholefood shop next door,in a very nice position and extremely convenient,only downside for a girl is no hairdryer!!!"
1108690,9293187,2013-12-19,1553033,Rupert,Really good location for site seeing and food. Laundromat close by sports bar. Room is simple but spacious.  Good wifi and kitchenette.  Bathroom a little awkward with hand held shower head over small tub. Hosts were very easy to work with and quick to respond when we asked to stay one more night. All up good value for your money.
1108690,9466602,2013-12-30,3870015,Alexey,Nice and simple apartment in a perfect location. Ideal for a short stay in Athens
1108690,9608529,2014-01-03,10423009,Mariella,"Sistemazione molto comoda per la collocazione. La casa e' molto spartana, e quindi non è perfetta per un soggiorno lungo ma va benissimo per uno breve. Il museo e l'acropoli sono proprio di fronte e c'è una trattoria vicinissima che consiglio. "
1108690,9747295,2014-01-07,10797397,Harjot,"Great studio apartment located near all major attractions in Athens, also very close to Metro station.  Apartment is simple and basic, but the cost and location are unbeatable.  Very friendly host! "
1108690,9881158,2014-01-16,4507073,Diego,"I spent almost 10 days in Ektoras place.
If you are a tourist you cant ask for a better place...the location make you feel like a Greek god and you are near to everything (touristic places, metro, supermarket) .

The apartment was really clean when I got there and it had almost everything I needed, the kitchen might be a bit basic (as the description say) but is enough for a short stay.

Ektoras is a really nice host, he was always available to answer me my doubts and help me, he even provide me of some kitchen stuff I asked.

I'd definitely go back again and recommend it! "
1108690,9962515,2014-01-21,9026893,Filipe,Great location. The flat is simple and efficient. I couldn't be in a better place. Leon was super helpful and easy to talk to.
1108690,10102493,2014-01-31,10867194,Kevin,"Thank you, i had a great journey in Athens. The appartement is very well located. Leon is kind. I wish you a good continuation."
1108690,10158467,2014-02-03,11250534,Walid,Superb location for an amazing price! The flat is located next to all the major attractions in Athens. The flat had everything you need to make for a great stay and was very clean. This was my first time renting with Airbnb and I will be sure to use it more often.
1108690,10180100,2014-02-04,4554085,Johanna,"The apartment is in even better shape than last year! So wonderful to stay so close to the Acropolis. Once again Leon is a great communicator, and made my arrival and departure very easy. Highly recommend!"
1108690,10295667,2014-02-11,4603849,Tim,"My stay at the flat was great, perfect location, clean and tidy! I would stay again. Leon was there to meet with me and showed me the flat. A fridge would be good, but I was seeing friends so had all food in the  lovely tavernas and bars in Plaka and surrounding areas. "
1108690,10498559,2014-02-22,1951826,Arpan,Very nice location and a nice small flat.
1108690,10588670,2014-02-26,2513408,Gabor,"The flat has a perfect location for those who want to do touristy things in Athens. It is rather small and simple (a fridge would be useful), but overall it is a super place for the price. Calm, bright and close to everything. And it has a restaurant next door (To Kati Allo) that has the best food in the continent...

Ektoras's friend Leon welcomed me kindly when I arrived and they were flexible when I had problems with closing the window (clumsy me).

I definitely recommend the place -- perfect for short stays."
1108690,10778735,2014-03-07,1615292,George,Awesome location and good host!
1108690,11053586,2014-03-18,9057757,Adriano,"Great location, nice apartment. Walking distance to most of Athens' archeological sites. Very close to public transportation. "
1108690,11087182,2014-03-19,12375497,Scott,It was ok. Small and not very clean. Very good location but too expensive for what we got
1108690,11122645,2014-03-21,5415439,Rowenn,Leon's place was very convenient to everything. Too bad I was only there for a night. Communication was followed through. I'd stay here again when I get back in Athens.
1108690,11354124,2014-03-31,5889746,Chuan,"Leon was very kind and the place was so close to everything. The only thing was the internet, not available during my stay. Overall, great experience!"
1108690,11471473,2014-04-04,7452721,JiaHan,"Very convenient location, literally just a turn away from the Metro station. Very close to the main attractions. The room is spacious and sufficient for a short stay. Overall, we had a satisfactory stay at this place!"
1108690,11643839,2014-04-10,11849895,Alfred,"The location of this apartment is excellent, it is literally 5 minutes from the Acropolis station and very easy to find.

Leon was nice and helpful with showing us the flat, even though we arrived at the flat quite late (around 10pm).

The flat itself wasn't very clean, there were a few flying insects which took us a while to capture. However overall I would say it is hygienic and did not cause much discomfort.

I do think this apartment is worth the price for its location and value. Ektoras and Leon are friendly hosts. "
1108690,11681589,2014-04-12,810731,Judy & Michael,"Good and responsive host, just steps from the acropolis and acropolis museum. Thanks Ektoras!"
1108690,11760246,2014-04-14,7826462,Adrian,"The perfect place for a few days in Athens.  Central (just around the corner from the wonderful Acropolis Museum) self-contained, and very reasonably priced.  Best local coffee / breakfasts are at the coffee shop on the corner at the top of Makrigianni."
1108690,11850828,2014-04-16,3589802,Aris,I stayed for one day and it was exactly what I was looking for! Recommended!
1108690,11891524,2014-04-18,9612023,Chuck," Kate and I enjoyed our stay in the Acropolis museum area. this flat is right next to the museum and close to all the shops and restaurants clean and quiet and made you feel at home.
Chuck & Kate "
1108690,12266273,2014-04-28,1716837,Florencia,"The apartment location is great, we walked everywhere. Leon recieved us, but Ektoras was really thoughtful, asking if we where fine a couple of times. The kitchen could have a fridge or a microwave, we didn't use it at all. Great place for a couple of days!"
1108690,12425637,2014-05-02,3073452,Laure,"This place is fantastic! It is literally steps from the Acropolis, the Acropolis Museum, the Metro, restaurants, and more. My flight arrived late but getting the keys was hassle-free. Great hosts and a great place to stay. I highly recommend it. "

1108690,12916039,2014-05-14,11884748,Ralph,Great location. Clean and comfy. Kitchen not much  very quiet
1108690,13149419,2014-05-20,11337494,Nona,We had a great stay at this flat! It's across the street from the Acropolis museum. We could easily walk around the old city and take the metro for longer distances. Our flight from Crete to Athens was delayed and we didn't have cell phone service but Leon patiently waited for us at the flat until our 11 PM arrival.
1108690,13301143,2014-05-25,9658656,Guy,"L'appartement est extrêmement bien situé pour visiter Athènes à pied, à proximité du musée de l'Acropole et donc de sa station de métro, tout près aussi d'un mini market. Pour la cuisine, il s'agit juste d'un évier et d'une taque chauffante, rien de vraiment très fonctionnel mais les bons restos ne manquent pas à Athènes. J'ai passé 3 belles journées à Athènes. Merci."
1108690,13365436,2014-05-26,984354,Angela,"Great Location, nice and clean apartment, friendly welcome and flexible host - everything was fine and I can particularly recommend the place for short stays as it is really central and well-connected to public transport"
1108690,13399336,2014-05-27,10858493,Jason,"The whole process was smooth and very easy to find.  Great location next to restaurants, shops, and services.  We wondered away from the Acropolis Museum to look for more places to eat, but it seems like everything is on one main street very well lit really close to this flat.  Would recommend for anyone wanting a convenient close cheap place to explore Athens.   "
1108690,13618913,2014-06-01,4984735,Trina,"the little flat was a pleasant stay and very convenient for metro and the acropolis.
we were provided with bed linens, towels and blankets. note: there is no fridge.
would stay here again for short no-hassle accommodation. "
1108690,13879727,2014-06-07,12845781,Madeleine,"Great place, perfect location and very helpful hosts!"
1108690,14387020,2014-06-18,12371902,Piotr,Amazing location! Its walking distance to many tourists attractions.  Place was clean and it did it for us.  All we did is sleep and shower there. As long as you don't any luxury this place is for you.  you can't beat the price and location.  i would recommend this place to my friends.
1108690,14676641,2014-06-24,11452655,Marko,"Wonderful location in the city centre! You do not need to use metro, everyhing is in walking distance, 1min to Acropolis museum, 5min to Acropolis entrance, 5min to Plaka etc. Only potential is to include refrigerator in the kitchen. Everyhing was great, apartment is clear value for money! If you don't care about luxury and you need apartment only for sleeping, choose Ektoras! There is no better deal!"
1108690,14738472,2014-06-25,9719707,Kristefer,"Our stay was fine. The apartment is a no frills apartment, just your very basics. I'm. It sure that it is really comfortable sleeping 2 on the bed, we didn't sleep to well. It is fine if you are just looking for a place to crash for a night. It is close to everything you want to see, which is nice. Nice family restaurant, cheap right on the same
Street. "
1108690,14810028,2014-06-27,10834642,Katie,"We had a lovely stay at the flat! It was the perfect location for the museum and acropolis as well as all the local restaurants and bars. It was nice and quiet as well. The flat is quite basic, but for a day or two it is perfect. Will definitely stay again!"
1108690,14948963,2014-06-30,11951490,Desiree,"We were met at the apartment right when we got there. Our flight was delayed so we were worried we would be too late to get the key, but Leon was waiting for us. He handed the key, gave a quick look over the apt with us and left. He was very nice. The apartment was exactly as described and is in a great location. So close to the Acropolis, Museum, and plaka area. It is also right next door to a great fruit market. The only thing I'd like to see there is a small fridge for breakfast items. Other than that, the place was perfect."
1108690,15175273,2014-07-04,13563292,Jill,Incredible location right by the Acropolis and all of the amazing restaurants/stores.  Very basic room. Host was available and helpful.  Perfect for our quick overnight stay.
1108690,15437267,2014-07-08,10971167,Charles,"Host is Leon, who appeared in a rush to leave as soon as we picked up the key. The apartment indeed is very close to Acropolis museum and there is a delightful, family-run taverna on the same block (To Kati Allo). Granted it's a bare-bones place that is well-situated, but still, 75 or so Euros is a lot of money for the place. The bathroom is small and the shower even smaller. There's barely enough space to crouch and since there is no shower curtain, you end up getting the whole floor wet - which is a bit humiliating. The soap on the sink was industrial and watered down. We didn't use the kitchen, but you wouldn't want to because there only a hotplate. Also, the photo of the Acropolis is a bit misleading given that there is no view. I would only book this place in an extreme last-minute situation, as we did, but even then it gave us the unpleasant feeling that the hosts are going for optimal profit with minimal effort. "
1108690,15590414,2014-07-12,9593880,Alim,"Awesome! He was very responsive when I had arrived to the location. Simple flat in a very accessible location. Thank you.
"
1108690,15689545,2014-07-14,9912319,Varun,Ektoras' mom welcomed us to the apartment and showed us around the property. The apartment is in a fantastic location and extremely clean and comfortable. Tons of great bars and restaurants within walking distance and very close to the metro. Would  highly recommend it for anyone looking to stay close to the Acropolis.
1108690,15947614,2014-07-19,2113039,Heather,"Amazing location, great apartment, want to stay again at the apartment on my next visit to Athens"
1108690,16038375,2014-07-20,17900581,Wonju,"The location is the biggest virtue of this flat. Close from the metro and Acropolis Museum, Acropolis entrance and Plaka. There is a fruit shop and a leather goods shop right next to the flat. It was also very convenient to have a place to leave luggage in 3 min walking distance even after we checked out this flat. Leon was also responsible. We faced a  power outage problem due to a fridge. Leon came to us right away and resolved it early in the morning. The bath room is small and there is no dining table but the entire flat was so clean. Quite much pleasant stay there. "
1108690,16229299,2014-07-23,7269851,Rodolfo,"Great place with an amazing location. Central to Acropolis museum, restaurants, cafés and other historical landmarks.
Ektoras was very hospitable. He was very flexible and hospitable. He met me at the front of the building and helped me with my luggage.
I would definitely stay here again.
Thanks Ektoras!! "
1108690,16253869,2014-07-24,208606,Kristine,I was met at the flat by Ektors' cousin. He was very sweet and helpful. I was only there for one night it but it was a perfect location to walk everywhere I wanted to go in Athens. The home was also very clean and well maintained. I would certainly stay there again!
1108690,16347704,2014-07-26,16087023,Clémentine,"It is a nice place near to the acropole it is perfect to visit athenes.Ektoras is very  considerate,he often text us to know if it was ok for us.fruit and water wait us at the flat. It was very cool."
1108690,16618132,2014-07-30,1578264,Olivier,"This flat is absolutely at the right location. 5 mn from acropolis, plaka and subway. This is a real good location.
There is no fridge, no table, just a bed and a simple bathroom, so it is a good location to sleep and no more. "
1108690,16721092,2014-08-01,6198327,Sey17,"The apartment was perfect for my purposes. Close to the Acropolis and in a central location. I felt very safe and had a wonderful time. Ekotras was quick to get back to me about everything and was flexible with a time to meet to get me set up, especially since I came in late. It was a great stay!"
1108690,16883216,2014-08-04,5436068,Amandine,We found Leon friendly but we are a little bit disappointed about the flat (warm water did not work) but the flat has a great location !!
1108690,16973247,2014-08-05,5436068,Amandine,We are a bit disappointed about the flat (did not fond the fridge and warm water) but the location is perfect !!
1108690,17040158,2014-08-06,14249298,Andrea,"The place was great for a one night stay in Athens. Very close to metro station and to streets with cool restaurants and shops. Would not recommend for more than 1 night as the ""bed"" (futon) was uncomfortable for 2 people. Host had cousin meet us at the place and Leon was very helpful and kind to us. Otherwise, never met the host and did not have much contact with him. "
1108690,17104155,2014-08-07,12294039,James,Great location in Athens! Perfectly suitable for 2 looking to explore the Acropolis.

Cordialement.

1108690,17637234,2014-08-15,4852427,Justine,"Very Nice situation for à quick visit of Athènes.
The place was clean and quiet.
We were welcomed by ektoras' cousin Léon : very friendly and clear in his explainations!

Everything was meant to Make us feel confortable! Which gave us very good impression! :)

We are not big fans of futon beds but away from that the flat gave us satisfaction on very level.
Big thanks to ektoras and Léon fort their Warm welcoming.

We recommend the place!! :D"

Der Akropolis ist direkt vor der Haus tür. Man kann überall zu fuss laufen.
Der Gastgeber war sehr hilfbereit, freundlich, nett."

1108690,18938094,2014-09-03,15673610,Jarrod,"I was welcomed by the host and the accommodations were just as described. The neighborhood was awesome. The apartment was very close to the Acropolis, the Acropolis Meuseum,  and tons of awesome restaurants. "
1108690,19013434,2014-09-04,17715073,Angela,"If you are looking for a place to stay for just a night in Athns, this place is perfect. It's close to all the main tourist attractions, in fact it's right in the middle of it all! The flat provides all the basics that are needed, but its definately the location that makes it a good pick. If you are staying longer, there are much nicer flats a little further away from the tourist crouds in local neighbourhoods.
We arrived on a flight from Naxos with two and a half hours delay, and were very lucky to still get into the flat in the very last minute just when we arrived. I guess things like this are annoying for both those arriving late and those waiting, but i would have been really annoyed if we got there and no one was around, and I guess these are things you need to work with as a host... Also you should know that the doorbell is labeled with ""Leon"", I'm not sure how we should have known that...
One of the rules of the house is to leave the place as you found it, which is a nice rule, but doesn't really eliminate the need for cleaning after the guests leave unless cleaning utensils are there and the guest is specifically asked to clean before leaving... When we were there, there was hair all over the bathroom, which definately wasn't from us, and that's a bit disgusting...
But for a night it was perfect :) Thank you!"
1108690,19046987,2014-09-05,20329643,Sandra,We were in Athens for a short time and where looking for a comfortable and well located place. We want to say that in Ektoras apartment we got exactly what we wanted. Every single place was near just walking distance. Thank you Ektoras

1108690,19753999,2014-09-17,4229232,Axel,We've never met the host. But that was entirely our fault. We found the key and had a lovely stay for 1 night. Great communication throughout the whole process of our stay. Neat and very clean room. We will keep the address and  if ever in Athens we will stay there again.

We stayed at the apartment for 2 nights either side of our trip to Santorini, and it really was the perfect place to be in in Athens. The apartment is right next to The Acropolis and The Acropolis Museum and has a huge array of restaurants right at your doorstep, while being super quiet so you can get a good nights sleep. It also has air conditioning which is a huge bonus. If you want to be right in your own neat and clean studio apartment in the heart of Athens, then I would definitely recommend staying in Ektoras's apartment."
1108690,20195681,2014-09-25,11783890,Bettina,"We were well received by our host Leon. The apartment's location is ideal, very close to the Acropolis museum. The apartment is small, but practical for a short stay. We are not sure if the idea to let the guests keep the place tidy and clean for the next one works out very well, but did our best to leave the apartment as we found it. "

Our host was helpful and communicated well: the location was very easy to find and we were greeted with the key when we got there.The WiFi, air conditioning and hot water were reliable, and there were basic offerings there if we needed them -- tea, shampoo, towels, etc. There is beer in the fridge you can buy for cheap which is cool. The screen was broken so we got some bugs but otherwise we were very happy! Thank you for having us Ektoras!"

1108690,21338566,2014-10-15,14107290,Lawrence,房子位置就在神庙及博物馆旁边，地铁步行也就3分钟路程，位置极佳，也很安全，周边咖啡休闲吧及超市样样具全。只住了1个晚上，挺舒适的。洗手间较为局促，淋浴的浴缸超级Q超级可爱，物有所值，推荐短租。
1108690,21531385,2014-10-19,4332968,Pascal,"Ektoras has a perfect studio right next to the Acropolis museum and from there you can walk everywhere. Besides, the subway station is 2 mn walk so it is perfect if you have to carry bags so no need of a taxi, you can get there directly from the airport or the Piraeus harbor. The place has the main basic things you need and it is clean and quiet.
I will definitely consider Ektoras's place for my next trip to Athens."
1108690,21600396,2014-10-20,20464994,Nitsan,"We stayed at the apartment on both ends of our stay in Greece. Both times we were welcomed by Leon, that was very available before each of our arrivals.
The location is perfect, just outside the Acropolis Museum and a short walk from Plaka and the Acropolis. It's a small and quite apartment, just enough to spend the nights - it is not big enough to host guests or anything like that.
The bath is tiny but with hot water (if you set the boiler in advance).
Very good WiFi and a useful kitchen for those of you who wish to cook for themselves."
1108690,21723196,2014-10-22,22192942,Magalie & Benjamin,"Petit logement très bien situé pour visiter Athènes. Aux portes de Plaka, très près du métro, au pied de l'acropole.

The WiFi worked well and the place is like it looks in the pictures and it's perfect to spend a few days in Athens.
1108690,22911839,2014-11-17,20119458,Shadi,"The apartment is located in a very good location near Acropolis and many restaurants. It is near the Agora and the ancient places  around there. Metro is near the price was fair.
After I booked the place we decided to change our plan and reduce number of days in Athenes and visit one of Greek islands. I contacted Ektros before more than one week from the reservation date . I sent him my request to modify the booking . Ektros  answered me after three days when the cancellation is charged. In his reply, he said he is not there for my everyday needs? It was a very rude answer !!

Ektros was not there when we arrived. Lio, his cousin was there waiting for us and he was very welcoming and friendly . The area is safe and quiet. The apartment ìs ok but not as neat and spacious as you see in the pics. The kitchen was clean and fairly equipped. Only one pan was there. The bathroom was not clean mainly the bathtub and walls around it ! . The towels looked very used and tired of repetitive use and washing. I recommend the apartment for its location only, however, you better find something more clean and comfortable."
1108690,23473369,2014-12-01,13241661,Farihah,"GREAT location even better host!
You could not design a better location - so convenient to the metro (access to the whole city), literally fown the road from the Acropolis and Plaka restaurants and shops but yet quiet and relaxing.
Leon was such a good host. When I ran into some troubles in Athens he went so far above and beyond to help me. Great person. If you stay here you'll have a friend in Athens."
1108690,23874928,2014-12-13,19202657,Josephine,"It was a great stay in Athens! The location is really close to the main tourist attractions, well located near the metro station and had a grocery store nearby. The host was very understanding and accommodating as well! "
1108690,24148087,2014-12-21,2398438,Ricky,"Extorts was a great host and waited for us to arrive since we were delayed due to the Athenian traffic! The place was super convenient, literally right outside the Acroplis subway station!! It was comfortable for two people and we spent one night there. The bathroom shower was a bit small but manageable. Overall nice place to stay if you want to live in the heart of all the action!"
1108690,25180299,2015-01-08,22421408,Leung,"Great location, easy to find, host was friendly.  But not much in the way of amenities."
1108690,25473776,2015-01-17,9868901,George,"We had a very pleasant stay at the apartment. It is in the center of Athens close to the Plaka, Metro, Busstop, restaurants, supermarkets and ofcourse the Acropolis! We could easily visit all places we had planned. Also by walking. The apartment is quiet and has all basic facilities. Thanks for the stay!"
1108690,25762440,2015-01-25,19902169,Alejandra,"The place is at it appears in the photo. Very comfortable and really close to the most important part of Athens for tourists.
Also, it was very clean and the communication with Leon (Ektoras' cousin) was very good! He was available all time. Totally recommendable"
1108690,25804028,2015-01-26,25574283,Manon,"The appartment is situated in a very nice neighboorhood and close to tourist-attractions. Ektoras was not home, but his kind cousin Leon explained us everything about the appartment. A good location and a relaxing experience. "
1108690,25972169,2015-01-31,4522171,Kurt,"Great location (truly around the corner from the Acropolis Museum), comfortable bed, full bath, and partial kitchen (fridge, hotplate, sink, dishes, soup pot, Greek coffee pot). Hosts very accomodating and very responsive. Not much of a view, but very pleasant nonetheless."
1108690,26251746,2015-02-08,12617449,Seth,"Basic, everything is alright. Super cheap, very near to the main attractions - the one that why you want to go there. Thanks "
1108690,26360289,2015-02-10,22260965,Liam,"Ektoras was waiting at the apartment when I arrived. The apartment was neat and orderly, as in the description, and well located within sight of the Acropolis and the nearby museum. His instructions were helpful and informative, and Ektoras aided me when the time came to check out. A good host."
1108690,26439476,2015-02-12,27078857,Anabela,"Leon (Ektoras cousin) was really kind to receive me and extremely hospitable. The house is extremely well located and right next to the Acropolis. It was snowing during my stay in Athens. Heating and hot water were not a problem. All the amenities were provided for a comfortable stay, and one can adventure making some Greek coffee.
I really recommend Ektoras. Good people and great location.
"
1108690,26811128,2015-02-19,16370136,Arman,"Apartment provides all basic stuff needed for a stay. But the best thing about this place is its location which is right next to Acropolis museum and very near to Acropolis. Considering it as an economic choice, it is totally worth it. Check-in was easy as Leon handed me the keys at the place."
1108690,27166034,2015-02-27,26323148,Susanne,"Ektoras was a great host. He was at the flat to meet us. Made sure we were happy and knew things. Then even checked in a day later to make sure all was OK.
The flat was in a very easy location to get around very good friendly place to eat just two doors down
The flat is just a basic one. But has all you need at a great price.
Thank you to Ektoras for the GREAT experience in Athens."
1108690,27828322,2015-03-13,1464903,Rasmus,"Lejligheden ligger centralt i Koukaki lige bag ved New Acropolis Museum, og Leon, som vi fik nøglen af, var flink, imødekommende og hjælpsom. Kan anbefales :-)"
1108690,28015373,2015-03-16,26799378,Thomas,the place wasn't as clean as the pictures. also the shower drainage didn't work at all. also the towel hanger on the wall fell off. overall good location though

1108690,28533384,2015-03-25,19309080,Christina,"Simple accommodations in a great location.  Ektoras and his cousin Leon were easy to obtain keys from, answers questions and resolve a minor plumbing issue.

The studio apartment has basic furnishings.  It is a good home base for all of your Athenian adventures.  Within a few minutes walk is the Acropolis, the Acropolis museum, Plaka and more architectural wonders. "
1108690,28904395,2015-03-31,26243378,Daniela,the apartement is easy to find. everything you need is there and leon is a nice guy. wifi is working perfectly. also it is quite. water is hot... i will book it again when i am back:-)
1108690,29140411,2015-04-04,21869706,Paula,"Very convient location, five minutes walk to subway and Acropolis as well. However I feel a little disappointed with the apartment : smell not so good, the sun couldn't shine into the room, also   the room is not soundproof."
1108690,29397698,2015-04-07,9088448,Minh,"Hektoras welcomed me at his place at a late hour, that was very kind of him.
He was very caring, gave me good tips and made sure everything was ok.
The place is very well situated, it is awesome: just behind the Acropolis and its museum and in a very quiet and safe area. You are also just 5 minutes walk from Plaka, a very lively district with many restaurants and bars. The metro station Acropolis is just at the corner.
The flat is well equiped, clean and the double bed is confortable. Ektoras left bottles of water and sodas in the fridge, which was very convenient.
For sure, I will return there next time I come to Athens.
Thanks Ektoras!"
1108690,29532928,2015-04-08,9088448,Minh,"I took one more night in Ektoras place and it was just perfect.
Thank you Ektoras;-)!"

The Acropolis Museum is just across the street, the Acropolis is so close,  and Syntagma square is 6 or 7 blocks away.  The apartment is very simple but it has everything you need. I recomend it to everyone. Tks Leon!"

The place is great for the price. Everything is in working order and Leon was great to communicate with. follow his recommendation for the best place to have baklava! It was amazing.

Great place, would stay again for sure  "

The metro station is around the block, but I walked everywhere because it was close to all the main attractions. I had the whole apartment to myself, including a private bathroom and a private kitchen. I really enjoyed staying at Ektoras's apartment. The apartment is very spacious. It has enough room for three people. Everything was perfect. "

Ektoras and Leon we're both super friendly and helpful, the appartment was clean and quiet, and the fridge filled with cold water and refreshments that are offered for a decent price and made me very happy when I forgot to stop at one of the kiosks or stores in the area! "

1108690,36108258,2015-06-25,28629475,Rita,"Ektoras  cancelled the reservation the day of my arrival because I didn't tell him the exact time of my arrival while he knew that I was coming that day. When I reached Athens, I read his message telling me not to go to the apartment. I called him to see what that was all about, he was mean and disgusting, trying to use every little excuse not to fulfill his side of the agreement. I booked this place and paid in advance but I was forced to find other living arrangement in Athens the same day. Bad host, please avoid signing with him."
1108690,36372794,2015-06-28,21409145,Ariel,The apartment was in a great location. Perfect for site-seeing

Would definitely stay there again

As soon as you enter the flat, you feel that it has been furnished with a lot of love for the detail. I also enjoyed very much the lively neighboorhood, there were a lot of Restaurants and Bars in walking distance. The flat is easy to reach from the city centre and the airport by metro (3 Minuten walk).All in all it was an amazing stay and I can only recommend the Zen Place to all people that put value on a lovely accomodation, I will definitely be back!Thanks a lot Peter!

1286210,37156993,2015-07-05,2216066,Jelena,"The apartment is beautiful and very cozy. I felt like at home, during my whole stay. It is wonderfully designed with a mixture of modern and antique furniture, and there is everything you need for short/long term stay. The location is perfect - there are several supermarkets on a walking distance, nice bakery - some restaurants. Most importantly, it is super close to the farmers market on Saturday mornings which is definitely a place to visit and you get all amazing veggies and fruits there.  It is also very close to the center - 10mins by metro/35 minutes walk. Both Peter and his mother were extremely nice and helpful! I definitely recommend!"
918812,3892519,2013-03-25,2295869,Stavroula,"Very nice apartment!

The location is awesome (2 minutes walk to metro), and very close to
Acropolis (10 minute walk). Also, many convenience stores and
cafeterias/restaurants nearby make it ideal as your little home during
your visit to Athens. The apartment was very clean when we upon
arrival, and it has everything you would want, and in very good shape.
Very nice vintage furniture and great decoration. Every detail was
very well curated!

Dimitris and his father Yannis were very friendly, extremely welcoming and great hosts!
They even gave us a very good recommendation for a local tavern where
we had a very nice lunch.

We would definitely stay there again!
"
918812,4081354,2013-04-08,3958655,Luke,"We had a fantastic stay with Dimitris - he and his father were VERY welcoming. The apartment is fantastic - simple, easy to find, in an absolutely PERFECT location. I'd stay hear again without question."
918812,4181938,2013-04-16,3801525,Brian,"We walk out of this great apartment, turn left, walk for about 20 meters; look right and see Hadrian's Arch, look left and up and see the Acropolis, look slightly left and see a small Byzantine Church. So what I'm saying is you cannot get abetted location for a visit to Athens. Plus, the apartment is awesome. I was thinking the semi-basement would be dark and cold but it was the opposite, quite light, warm, and charmingly decorated. Basically, I want to live there. Everything was super clean, the water hot and plenty of cooking supplies (the kitchen is on the small side but for our purposes, it was perfect). Dimitris and his sister were so helpful and nice; giving us information on local places to eat, transportation, laundry, etc., and some great tasting homemade raki. I highly recommend this apartment! "
918812,4409364,2013-05-03,5751672,Eelin,"Location is fantastic - Quiet street in Plaka; Acropolis, Acropolis Museum, Tourist Information office, Temple of Olympian Zeus all within 10min walking radius; Makrigianni street which is filled with nice cafes just round the corner.
Apartment is clean, everything works, looks just like the photos.
The hosts - Dimitris and his dad - gave me a Greek welcome enough to start my Athens trip on a high!.Dimitris was very contactable and responses fast. On top of that,.he even sent me to a bus terminal in outskirts of Athens, made sure I got the right ticket and showed me where to board the bus to Sparta!
Location, cleanliness, privacy, great hosts - you really don't need to look any further!"
918812,4480546,2013-05-07,382184,Martin & Eric,"We stayed in Athens 4 days and Dimitris made our stay so pleasant and comfortable.   His attitude towards his guest was one of great joy and caring.   We immediately felt we had family in the city and  someone who truly cared about us.
We also had the GREAT pleasure of meeting his Sister who obviously got the good looks in the family.   She too was so friendly and helpful we most definitely recommend that you stay and take advantage of their wonderful hospitality.
The beautiful bikes they provided were new, and made for a wonderful day out and around the city.     Oh yea, it's a perfect location to see everything you would want to see within walking distance.    Thanks once again for our beautiful apartment and stay in Athens. "
918812,4618110,2013-05-15,2259231,Judith,"It is a nice place, really quiet at night. Even being in a semi-basement you get direct sunlight in the morning :) The location is fantastic!! As other reviewers mentioned, you are meters away from Hadrian Arch, really close to the Acropolis. You have lots of shops and restaurants in the area. You are also very close to two of the main metro (underground) lines, so from there you can get to almost anywhere! Dimitris is a great host, he gave us a warm welcome and was available for anything we might need. We would certainly recommend the place or come again ourselves!"
918812,4812247,2013-05-27,6171445,Carlyn,"Amazing!!  Loved the apartment and Dimitris!  Dimitris and his father were so nice and extremely welcoming!  Excellent communication and he went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed the entire stay!  The apartment was adorable, very clean and comfortable.  The location was absolutely perfect and safe no matter what time of day we were coming and going!  Right next to the Acropolis, Hadrian's Arch, and the shops and restaurants in the Plaka!   Would stay here again in a heartbeat and plan to the next time I am in Athens!"
918812,4970944,2013-06-04,2010892,Yassin,"Since the moment I first contacted Dimitris he was being very nice and accommodating. He provided us with really clear indications to get to the appartement. About the appartement: staying anywhere else in Athens would be a mistake!!! Location is incredible!!!!!! The appartement is small but has everything you need for a short stay. Dimitris and his father greeted us with a bowl of fruits and  a small bottle of some local alcohol!  They were available and getting in touch with them was really easy!
Thank you for this wonderful stay!"
918812,5054246,2013-06-10,3394312,Lim,"The accommodation is exactly same as the photos. Also, the location is perfect, safe, lovely!! near the metro, its very convenient to the place you wish to. 2 Cycles are provided, just same as the description he show us. The host is nice!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  "
918812,5294679,2013-06-23,6231552,Loren,"We had a fantastic time in Athens and it was largely due to our extremely well positioned accommodation. The basement room is cool and quiet which is essential if you need a siesta or just a post-jet-lag nap.
Dimitiris was a thoughtful and kind host. My husband forgot some medication at home and Dimitiris found us a late night chemist and sent directions. Well beyond expectations. "
918812,5471331,2013-07-01,2680122,Constantine,Awesome and neat place in the middle of the Plaka. Friendly & generous hosts. Recommended!
918812,5562449,2013-07-06,6229880,Felicity,"I cannot speak highly enough of Dimitris and our stay at Athens Soul. Firstly, the apartment is perfectly located in the Plaka district, so close to many restaurants, and all the touristy things there are to do in Athens. My husband and I stayed at Dimitris' apartment for 4 days and in that time walked everywhere. Even dragging my ridiculously heavy suitcase from the train station (Acropoli) was easy as it was only 5 minutes (probably only 2 if you walk without luggage!) Very clean and plenty of space.

Secondly, Dimitris takes the word host to another level. Communication was excellent - any question I had, from ferry bookings to where to get a massage after my 20 hour flight, was met with ""let me do some research and i'll get back to you,"" which he did within 24 hours at the most (usually half an hour!). The biggest praise (and thank you) I have for Dimitris is, before I booked when I asked him if he knew about taxis to his apartment as my husband was on a different flight and arrived at 1.30am. Dimitris advised us that taxis were very expensive at that time in the morning, and offered to pick him up for a much more reasonable fee! This won me over completely, as it was such a kind offer at that time of the morning! And then when my husband was late meeting him as his bags had gone missing at the airport, Dimitris waited around, in constant communication with me until my husband turned up and dropped him off at 3am.

Dimitris as host and Athens Soul apartment is the only way to go if you want a hassle free stay in Athens!"
918812,5788874,2013-07-16,6516812,Nathan,"Three words: location, location, location!!! This is a very tidy, cute little apartment right at the heart of everything you want to do as a tourist in Athens.
The host Dimitris is wonderful as well. He greeted us with everything we needed to know about the place and being a local he can help you out with anything you may need to know about the city as well. The air conditioning was a Godsend as the temperature was up in the mid 30's during our stay.
It's cosy, quiet and as I say so centrally located to things like the Acropolis and Acropolis musuem as well as being within easy walking distance of the shopping and eating areas of Plaka and Monastiraki.

Would definitely recommend this place and stay there again."
918812,5890884,2013-07-21,6802957,Jelle,"Dimitris' place was excellent for its location (around the corner of the Theater of Dionysus and the Acropolis Museum) and spacious room, kitchen, and bathroom. Dimitris was also helpful beyond comparison: he helped us to find places to go and kept us up to date with recent events that would have made traveling at a particular day more difficult (e.g. strikes had made it impossible to take the metro from certain stations). I would most definitely stay here again. The fact that the apartment is in the basement should not stop you: it means it is cool and quiet, while it still has windows to get a breeze in."
918812,6015328,2013-07-26,6518839,Priya & Michael,"As first timers to Athens, we could not have picked a better place to stay! The apartment is great and within easy walking distance to all the major attractions (turn the corner and there's the Acropolis!), has air conditioning (which made us very happy!) and has lots of room.

Despite the fact that Dimitris was away on vacation (we didn't meet), he was quick to respond to all of our queries and even gave us a call to clarify details. His dad met us outside the train station and took us to the apartment, where we also met Dimitris' sister who gave us all the details we'd need. They were awesome, and his dad even shared a welcome raki with us!

We had an amazing time in Athens, and would definitely stay here again!"
918812,6195713,2013-08-03,6922788,Peta,"Fantastic apartment! Location is perfect - no public transport required, and close to well priced restaurants (Dimitris can recommend some, away from tourist area).
Dimitris is a dream host - friendly, responsive. Gave brilliant directions and met us on arrival with his lovely father - they had breakfast items for us, and also welcomed us with a Greek toast!

Highly recommend this apartment - if you're visiting Athens, stay here! It's a cool oasis from the heat of Athens, and life was wonderful staying here."
918812,6590488,2013-08-18,359109,Leo,"The apartment is perfectly located in the very center of Athens, at 200 meters of Acropolis metro, and near all pedestrians’ streets.
Before our arrival, Dimitris sent us a perfect summary on how to get to the flat and him and his father gave us a very good welcoming. They invited us to a house made Raki, traditional Greek digestive.
They gave us good advices and insisted that we could count on their help for anything.
We couldn't enjoy the 2 bikes that go with the flat, as my couple was pregnant, but it can be a good way to discover Athens!!
We definitely recommend Dimitris flat for a good stay in Athens !!
"
918812,6706990,2013-08-22,6627342,Dawn,"Wow, what a great and affordable place in a wonderful and quiet location!  We were met by Dimitris' father in front of the apartment.  He showed us how everything worked and welcomed us with a toast of his home-made raki.  The apartment itself was just what we needed for our three days of sightseeing in Athens, clean and convenient.  The location could not have been better.  We will definitely stay in Dimitris' apartment again when in Athens!"
918812,7025754,2013-09-03,8219199,Keith,"Dimitris was there on the street, in front of the apt. Waiting for us. We had our welcoming drink and all questions answered and those he didn't have the information for he emailed to us promptly,he is very gracious and helpful. The apt. Is snug and cozy and just what I was looking for, within walking distance to most everything. On my first evening,with a short walk I found a place to sit,order a beer and look up at the lite up Acropolus. Thanks for everything Dimitris.
Keith, Morgan and Meara"
918812,7094267,2013-09-06,7211217,Mehrunnisa,this is the first time we used air bnb. dimitris' apartment had an excellent location and was fully equipped. we had a warm welcome with raki. in addition dimistris really helped us out with any queries we had regarding getting around athens! i highly recommend athen's soul apartment!

918812,7402999,2013-09-18,8641163,Angela,"Great location - walking distance to the Acropolis, Plaka, Monastiraki and Syntagma Square, we never needed to take the bus or subway. We gave Dimitris our flight # and he tracked our flight when it was delayed and met us at the apartment at 1am with all the info we needed for our stay and some raki! Anything we needed, Dimitris was happy to provide like directions to the ferry port for the Greek Islands and places to eat."
918812,7739728,2013-10-01,7788086,Puja,"Hi Folks! Dimitris and his dad Yannis are good and thoughtful hosts. The apartment has everything you might need for a short stay. The free bikes are a bonus too...Location is excellent - you can walk everywhere you possibly need to go as a tourist. Incase you dont have constant internet or phone access while travelling,its best to email and agree on a meeting time well in advance.While at the apartment you should definitely try some of the homemade raki - and if you drink it thinking its water like I almost did you will definitely be well buzzed for the next few hours :P"
918812,7878498,2013-10-07,4255979,Steve,The location is perfect for seeing all the major sites in Athens!  Simply perfect.  Close to everything but on a quiet street.  Dimitris's father met us outside and down the street so it was super easy.  It is also really close to a Metro stop which is also helpful.  The apartment is clean and big enough.  Kitchen a little small but no big deal.  He provided a couple pieces of fruit and some packaged pastry which was nice.  The bed is ok size but it is pretty firm so if you like a softer bed keep that in mind.  He also has bikes avaiable to use as well as helmets and a lock.  Really great place and super good price.  I totally recommend this apartment.
918812,8252787,2013-10-22,7960757,Tallita,Was amazing stay in Dimitris' apartment. Thank you so much.
918812,8520909,2013-11-04,8583765,Karin,"Great location, safe neighborhood. The pictures don't lie. The bedroom was spacious and newly decorated. Bathroom, kitchen and hall are clean, every thing works as it should but the floor is very old and maybe needs some attention. I loved my 8 nights stay here. The only thing missing was my name next to the doorbell!
Thanks Dimitris!"
918812,8685898,2013-11-12,8427566,Annik,We loved our stay at Dimitris place. The appartement is excellent located in a quiet corner in Plaka in walking distance of the Acropolis museum (recommanded!).   We had a wonderful time. Nice breakfast and dinner places around the corner. Our son of 9 stayed with us in the room on a spare bed. Dimitri is friendly and helpfull. We definetely can recommand his place!
918812,9000208,2013-12-01,9167516,Rachelle,"Dimitris was a friendly, patient and responsive host. We missed our connecting flight to Athens and had to catch a later flight, but he was still able to meet us close to midnight to give us the keys and get us settled into the apartment. The apartment was great! Clean, spacious for two people and very close to all the main tourist attractions and the metro. Do not hesitate to book this apartment."
918812,9542429,2014-01-02,9571113,Ivi,"dimitris came to pick us up at the metro station with two extra umbrellas, because it was raining. he brought us to the apartment, offered us a glass of delicious homemade raki, and left.
the flat is nice, perfect for a short stay in athens, it had everything we needed, and the location is great!
totally recommendable.  "
918812,9852635,2014-01-14,10564933,Kalliopi,"We had a great time in Athens, and we totally enjoyed staying in Athens Soul Apartments. Dimitris and his dad Jannis are great hosts, Dimitris was always very fast to answer any questions we might have had, and always there to help us with anything we needed.

The apartment is very cosy and beautifully decorated. The main room/bedroom is very spacious and has a closet where you can actually walk in! The kitchen is small but fully equipped with everything you may need for cooking.

Highlights: 1. Welcoming raki (plus a bottle of home-made tsipuro from Dimitris' trip to Volos), 2. A plate with home-made Christmas delicacies, 3. Two free bicycles (plus helmets), 4. The location of the apartment: very centrally located yet in a quiet and safe neighborhood, in a walking distance from all the main attraction sites, and two minutes away from the Akropolis metro station, 5. Cleanliness: the apartment was spotlessly clean and smelled very nice.

Overall a great stay in the heart of Athens, an apartment with a warm and very welcoming host. We definitely recommend Athens Soul Apartments, and would certainly stay there again in our future visits to Athens. Thank you Dimitris!"
918812,10026573,2014-01-26,1981374,Antoine,What a great location for staying in Athens! The apartment has everything you need for your stay. We got a warm welcome with Dimitris dad and shown us the place. I will highly recommend this apt to visit Athens. So many good restaurants around!
918812,10882562,2014-03-11,4746995,Marten,"Es war alles wie beschrieben, mir hat es sehr gefallen. Die Wohnung liegt super zentral, die Fotos auf Dimitris's Angebot entsprechen dem Zustand der Wohnung genau. Ich würde die Unterkunft jedenfalls meinen Freunden empfehlen.
Vielen Dank"
918812,11280483,2014-03-28,12116059,Shannon,"We had a great stay at Dimitris' place. The location couldn't have been better for us. We were in Athens for just a few days and wanted to be close to the main sights (namely the Acropolis), and it was a bonus to be so close to the Acropoli metro stop. There are some great restaurants and little shops around as well... just gotta look pasty the touristy ones. :) The room was extremely spacious, warm, and we don't have a single complaint. Thanks to Dimitris' dad for meeting us and showing us around. Lovely spot and recommended to couples visiting Athens for a short stay."
918812,11362054,2014-03-31,5176998,Kacey,"Dimitris and his father were great hosts, and communication was always prompt and helpful. The room is beautiful and in the perfect location. Highly recommended!"
918812,11528568,2014-04-07,10003945,Marina,"Un appartement tout simple mais ultra bien pensé.
Tout d'abord l'emplacement: juste idéal! On ne peut faire mieux, sous l'Acropole, face aux Colonnes d'Hadrien, plein centre et pourtant, dans une petite rue très calme.
Dimitris a pensé à tout, jusqu'au lisseur à cheveux! Bref, pour une escapade à Athènes sans chichi avec toutes les commodités souhaitées, c'est une adresse formidable.
Et puis un petit mot à propos de Dimitris dont la gentillesse est à souligner... nous attendre avec le sourire, les clefs à la main à 02h30 du matin semble tout à fait normal pour lui. A l'image des Athéniens, il est naturellement aux petits soins.
Merci Dimitris, et à très vite j'espère!"
918812,11827219,2014-04-16,3933084,Peter And Barbara,"Both prior to and after our arrival, Dimitris was very responsive to all of our many questions. He is very friendly and met us promptly at the apartment at the agreed time, welcoming us with some raki. The apartment itself was great, and as other reviewers have indicated, the location is unbeatable, just around the corner from the new Acropolis Museum. We stayed here for 4 nights and were easily able to walk to every tourist attraction in the city. It is clean and well equipped, the WiFi works well, and there is lots of hot water. When we return to Athens, we will definitely stay here again. For the price (approx. 42 euro a night), we think this is tremendous value for a prime location in Athens. Thanks Dimitris, and a special thanks for immediately coming to our rescue at 11 p.m. at night when we stupidly locked ourselves out of the apartment!"
918812,11952426,2014-04-20,4816100,Arun,"We loved our stay in Athens mainly thanks to the brilliant location of this flat. Just round the corner is the main shopping street, way to Acropolis, the metro station and the temple of Zeus. Dimitris's father had been waiting for us though we were a little late because of the queue at the airport. He explained us everything and was very polite and welcoming. Dimitris himself was very reactive and helpful when we needed something. I would recommend this place to everyone who wants to enjoy their stay in Athens. "
918812,12689342,2014-05-08,5021221,Robert,"Yiannis, Dimitris' father gave us an especially warm welcome and a very thorough briefing on the apartment. There was some thoughtful and welcoming food and drink, as well as a welcoming toast with Yiannis with raki!. The apartment was very clean with good quality fittings and furniture and Dimitris and Yiannis obviously make a special effort to make it as comfortable and amenable as possible; for instance there were two bikes available for our use, with lights and locks, and helmets! There were 2 umbrellas! Also the kitchen was well equipped.  We had reservations about staying in a basement but there was a small outside area with very good light and ventilation into the main room, and there were views of pedestrians on the street, and even sunlight in the bedroom in the morning (spring time). It also very, very quiet although only a 200 meters or so from the temple of Zeus and the Acropolis Museum in a residential street, an extremely central location. Above all we'd recommend these guys for their thoughtfulness and warmth (they also very generously followed up on a lost property issue for us). Thank you Yiannis and Dimitris."
918812,12879490,2014-05-13,11857799,Luqman,"Dimitris' sister was the one who picked us up from the station because i got lost. Metro is like 2 mins walk away. The Acropolis and the musuem is 3 mins away. Extremely good location. And the apartment was in excellent condition and very spacious. There were buns and coffee powder for us to use. Wherever we went after a long day, it was nice to come back to our apartment."
918812,13000148,2014-05-17,12076553,Alayna,This apartment is wonderful and the hosts as well. Yiannis welcomed us with glorious hospitality and Dimitris answered many questions by email. The central and safe location as well as access to bikes made our stay truly spectacular. Would absolutely recommend.
918812,13340232,2014-05-26,5202180,Rosemary,"We were met by Dimitris' father outside the apartment, which was easy to find from the Acropolis Metro station following the directions given to us. We loved the location of the apartment, right in the Plaka district, an easy walk to the Acropolis Museum and all the wonderful attractions of Athens. It also felt very safe, and was lovely to walk around in the evenings. The apartment was exactly as we had expected from the photos on the listing, and we were happy with our choice for our Athens stay, it was great value for money."
918812,13565666,2014-05-31,11097079,Chelsey,Dimistris apartment is in the most amazing area in Athens! I couldn't have asked for a better location. You can see the Acropolis from the streets and it's literally right up the block. It's surrounded by fun little restaurants and amazing shops. We would definitely stay here again!
918812,13844163,2014-06-06,13344282,Steve,"This apartment was great. The Wi-Fi worked well, the bed was comfortable and the location was superb. Dimitris and his father, Yannis, were great hosts. My wife and I were very happy in Athens!!"
918812,14075762,2014-06-11,545023,Tory,The apartment is in a perfect location. Walking distance to everything. We were greeted warmly and were provided with help throughout our stay when we needed. We would recommend with highest regards! Thanks for everything!
918812,14229191,2014-06-15,13969612,Stephen,"Amazing location!  The apartment is practically next door to the Acropolis.  We received a warm welcome from Yiannis, Dimitris' father.  There was fruit, cold beer, and our welcoming drink of raki waiting for us when we arrived.  What more could we ask for?"
918812,14386711,2014-06-18,6725167,Karine,"ótimo apartamento, localização fantástica!próximo a tudo, vizinho a acrópole =). O pai do Dimitri que nos recepcionou, muito gentil nos explicou sobre a cidade e o apartamento nos deixou frutas, e tomou conosco uma bebida tipica Grécia (cachacinha brava!kkk). Super recomendado!"
918812,14739633,2014-06-25,14991298,Denise,"We had a great time staying in Dimitris' apartment in the Plaka area of Athens which is the old part of the city. It is a touristy area but very pretty and charming, quite different to what we saw of the rest of Athens. The location is brilliant - it's about 5 minutes' walk to the Acropolis Museum; also to Hadrian's Wall and the Temple of Zeus. The Acropolis is about 10 minutes' walk. It is about 3 minutes' walk from the Acropolis Metro station, which meant we didn't have to wheel our luggage very far at all. We didn't meet Dimitris but his father Yiannis met us and kindly showed us where everything was. He gave us his phone number in case we had any problems but we didn't need to call him. The apartment was clean and the bed had nice crisp white sheets. The wifi and aircon worked perfectly. We didn't do any cooking there as there are many tavernas in the area and we also found a place just opposite the metro station that made great gyros for a very reasonable price. The only slight negative was the fact that the apartment was semi-basement. The spacious main room, which has a double bed, desk, and table and chairs, gets a little bit of natural light and has doors that can be opened if you want some fresh air. The kitchen and bathroom don't get any natural light. However we did not see this as a big issue as we just turned on the lights! Anyway, the advantages of the apartment far outweighed the disadvantages."
918812,14901462,2014-06-29,11376829,Nicola And Geoff,This apartment was so central to the metro and the plaka area it was great.restaurants 1 minute  away and the acropolis just up the street.metro easy to use from airport.friendly host yannis greeted us and offered to help with anything.
918812,15583282,2014-07-12,756216,Derek,You cannot beat the location of this place! Right in the centre of it all and very close to metro. It is in the basement of an old building so there are a few quirks but Dimitris responds in no time and makes it a pleasant stay. Thanks!
918812,16060355,2014-07-21,8693794,Zaki,Awesome location and excellent hosts. Clean and comfortable. Sufficient amenities for two to live comfortably for the week right in the center of the tourist district. Air conditioning allowed us to sleep peacefully. Bikes are available although we had no time to use! Loved our time in Greece and the warmth of the people.  Thanks to our hosts for their hospitality!
918812,16456384,2014-07-28,13364178,Yana,"Fantastic communication from Dimtris, very helpful, friendly and responsive from the moment we booked.  This is a great little apartment in a wonderful, quiet location, literally a few steps from the Acropolis and Temple of Zeus.  The apartment is in the heart of Plaka with restaurants, bars and metro only a couple of minutes away.  We would definitely stay here again, Athens is stunning.  Can not recommend it highly enough."
918812,16709303,2014-08-01,6028760,Charlotte,Dimitris and his father Yainnis were excellent hosts. The apartment is really easy to get to from the airport. Greeted on arrival by shots of raki and snacks for breakfast we were well set up for our stay in Athens. The apartment is in a great location at the foot of the acropolis. If you want to venture further you can get on the metro nearby too. Thanks for a great stay! Charlotte and Kirsty xx
918812,17040240,2014-08-06,8496715,Alina,"Это действительно очень удобная квартира в очень удачном месте. Если бы я показала пальцем на карте, где в Афинах удобнее всего остановиться - это был бы дом Димитриса.
Да, это полуподвал, но по утрам там есть солнце, там все хорошо проветривается, а в остальное время дня квартира не так нагревается даже в августе, мы спали без кондиционера.
Квартира расположена в тихом переулке, нас иногда беспокоили только люди, проходящие мимо вечером и громко разговаривавшие друг с другом, но это было не очень поздно даже в субботу.
Столик, что стоит у стены, на самом деле более удобный для того чтобы за ним поесть вдвоем, чем это может показаться на фотографии. Кроме того, там все-таки есть большое зеркало в полный рост, оно нашлось на внутренней дверце шкафа.
Теплый прием отца Димитриса, фрукты, ракия и круассаны - это очень приятно.
В ванной на кранах перепутаны местами обозначения теплой и холодной воды, и коврик от скольжения там висит не зря - советую обязательно воспользоваться им.
Соотношение цена-качество просто отличное. Мы остались довольны.

"
918812,17276014,2014-08-10,5282995,Catherine,"It was a fantastic apt and Dimitirs and his father were welcoming, kind, and made sure you reached the apt without hassle. The location is great, lots of great restaurants and walking distance to all the ancient sites"

Nous avons été très bien accueillis par le père de Dimitris et nous recommandons cet appartement pour les couples!
Dimitris propose nombreuses petites attentions pour ces hôtes, ce qui fait son charme (plans, conseils de choses à visiter, café grecs, petit apéritif en arrivant, vélos à disposition, de l'eau fraiche dans le frigo etc.)."

918812,18394922,2014-08-26,10963310,Paul,"Great location, cool apartment and excellent host at a very reasonable price. What more can you ask for! The apartment has all you need for 1 person or a couple. It is right near the Acropolis and many other places of interest. The metro is very close as are buses and trams.
Plaka is a very lively neighbourhood with many good restaurants and the usual tourist shops.
Dimitris is a wonderful host. We had a 1:00 am arrival and Dimitris kindly met us at the bus station.
The apartment is great value for money and we would definitely stay again. Thank you Dimitris for making our stay most enjoyable."
918812,18725587,2014-08-31,6227557,Dana,"What a fabulous stay!
Me and my boyfriend arrived in Athens at noon, Dimitris wasn't there but his father was there to greet us on time, very nice and welcoming. The apartment location was perfect. Very close to the metro (which you can take to go ANYWHERE) , close to a ton of cafes and shops. The apartment it self was very clean and had everything you need!"

The location couldn't have been better and he was very easy to access whenever we had questions. The place was a good size for my friend and I as well. It looks just like the pictures and Dmitris was very accommodating, would definitely recommend staying with him!

We felt so at home with the way we were welcomed, the apartment is in a perfect location and it is also very clean and cosy. We loved every minute of being in Athens and even more so since we had such a nice place to stay in. Unfortunately for us our stay was not long enough!! So we will be back. We definitely reccommend anyone to stay in Dimitris' apartment! Thank you for making our first trip to Greece one we wont forget.

The stay was very comfortable and we had everything we needed. You cannot beat this location!! Right in the heart of Athens and only a few minutes walk to the Acropolis. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone!

We had the pleasure of staying at Dimitris` apartment for three days, and I must say, we couldn`t have chosen a better location - very near the acropolis and many attractions. Dimitris was very nice and helpful, giving us tips of how to get there. His father was at the apartment - he showed us around and we had a welcome drink - very nice. The apartment is great for a nice rest after a long day of walking through Athens - I would definetely recommend it!"

They made our experience in Athens much better that was supposed to be. We reccomend!"
918812,22149613,2014-10-31,21785980,Nataliya,"We were warmly welcomed by Dimitris's father who waited for us outside and showed everything in the apartment. We appreciated the shots of local alcohol, beer, fruits and croissants offered at the arrival. The apartment was great and very well located. We really enjoyed the location since it was closed to everything we needed.
The internet connection was great as well. (which is very important for travelers who need to use skype like us)
Thank you for this experience!   "

Like was met by his father at the apartment and after a tour of the place we took shots of greek liquor together. There are some free snacks and beers provide from him too, making the place feel home-y as soon as I arrived. The neighborhood is right in the center of all the sights I wanted to see while in Athens. I was less than 10 minutes of walking from all the reatairants, ancient temples, and museums I wanted to go to. The apartment would host two easily, and three could stay there comfortably too. The wifi worked perfectly, and the heater worked great. "
918812,23962576,2014-12-15,24132037,Diana,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here! I did not meet Dimitris directly but his father was there to welcome us in.  Due to a later flight he even stayed to wait for our arrival and was very helpful with providing directions! Very welcoming host with goodies and traditional Greek treats prepared.   The place was very comfortable and there was also two bikes available for use if needed.  If I were to return to Athens I would definitely come back!
918812,24300193,2014-12-25,3590573,Deepak,"Thank you Dmitris, Yiannis and the lovely mother for making our honeymoon so memorable! Right from the start, the warm welcome with walnut honey syrup, the traditional Greek grape juice, the bedroom decorated with flowers, all made us so overwhelmed. It's proximity to Acropolis and all other tourist place makes this place a must stay in Athens.
I strongly recommend this place to anyone planning to visit Athens. Fantastic hospitality and superb location makes it a place to "" Come Here Again""."
918812,24623758,2014-12-31,12086254,Andrey,"I stayed in this apartment in the end of December, 2014.  The host was friendly, he gave me all detailed information about this apartment. The apartment is placed in old building in the historical center of Athens, i.e. the location of the apartment is quite good for any trips in Athens.
There is only one drawback there, the apartment is placed underground (minus one floor), but it was not so critical for me because I traveled a lot and I came back to the apartment after sunset."
918812,24933305,2015-01-04,23242132,Andrea,"As soon as me and boyfriend arrived, we were greeted by his father who had little treats and raki on hand. Very sweet and welcoming. The place was clean, the heater worked well. Thank goodness! Also, the location of this place was great. A 2min walk to the Temple of Olympian and 4min walk to Acropolis. Awesome!"
918812,25249829,2015-01-10,22953275,Jean-François,"Nous avons été très bien reçu. La chambre était tel qu'indiqué et le lieu où elle est située est idéal pour ceux et celles qui veulent visiter l'Acropole et ses environs. Une seule ombre au tableau, pour cette période de l'année le système de chauffage a eu de la difficulté à suppléer aux conditions météorologiques particulièrement froides surtout la nuit. Enfin, si vous comptez manger surtout à l'extérieur et n'utiliser la chambre que pour dormir, le rapport qualité prix, compte tenu de la location idéale du logement est bon."
918812,25350685,2015-01-13,15417163,Nelli,"Nice and clean apartment very close to all sightseeing, can walk basically everywhere. The apartment is also fully equipped and even has hair straightener (though I brought mine).Dimitris was very efficient in his communication and his friend who let us in was very friendly. A very kind gesture from the host to leave us some traditional pastries and drinks. "
918812,25844067,2015-01-27,1858676,Jeannine & Claude,"Nous avons été très bien accueillis par le père de Dimitri. L'appartement est très bien situé à moins de cinq minutes à pied du métro, du musée et du site de l'Acropole. Il était très propre, confortable, bien chauffé en saison froide mais situé en sous-sol et n'offrant pas de vue. Il est plutôt rudimentaire pour cuisiner mais il y beaucoup de restaurants à proximité. Le quartier est sécuritaire et  intéressant à parcourir à pied. Bon rapport qualité/prix pour les voyageurs qui souhaitent passer du temps à l'extérieur et visiter."
918812,26102053,2015-02-03,15645474,Marilena,"Dimitris è molto accogliente, l'appartamento è funzionale e pulito.
La posizione comodissima è in centro quindi è possibile visitare Atene passeggiando perchè vicino alle attrazioni principali. vicino anche alla fermata del (website hidden) siamo trovati molto bene

918812,26304479,2015-02-09,2094491,Gabriella,"The location of Athens South Apartments (Plaka) was perfect! A quick walk to major sites including the Acropolis, Hadrian's Arch, Syntagma square, Hephaestus' Temple, and much more.  We packed a ton into just 3 days and the apartment made it possible! Dimitris' father, Yanus, met us with shots of Raiki, pastries, and fruit and showed us everything we needed to know about the apartment.  The apartment is partly underground, so there isn't a view, but the comfort and location completely make up for that. Highly recommended."
918812,26458623,2015-02-13,25842197,Alex,"Dimitris's father met us at the apartment and gave us a warm welcome (with a shot of raki and some cold beers in the fridge!)
It is a very nice apartment, with plenty of room, a good shower/bathroom and a small kitchen; the place was exactly as per the photos. We stayed in a cold, snowy February, but were never cold in the apartment - there is central heating, an air conditioner and a portable electric heater... so no worries there! The bed is very comfy.
The location of the apartment could not possibly be better. Literally 2 minutes walk to the gates of the Acropolis and right in the heart of everything. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay in the apartment. Well worth the money and totally hassle-free.
There were 2  bikes for us to use too as the listing said... but we didn't brave it in the snow!"
918812,26994818,2015-02-23,23704593,Sara,"the apartment is really nice and location is great. we haven't met  Dimitris, it was his father who was waiting for us and he was really kind and friendly.he explained us everything. we loved this place and Athens. i strongly recommend it to everyone."

918812,27511737,2015-03-06,22457122,羽裳,So wonderful a apartment that we had a very nice vacation. The apartment is near to many main attractions. The location is perfect. Dimitris is very kind and the two bikes he lended us are nice too. We will never forget this experience in Athens.
918812,28417819,2015-03-23,22039969,Sara,"Un apartamento PERFECTO! RECOMENDADO 100%! La comunicación con Dimitris es fácil desde el principio, está siempre disponible, y la bienvenida de su padre hizo que el viaje empezara de la mejor manera.

El apartamento está en Plaka, la mejor zona de Atenas para hacer turismo y disfrutar al máximo de la ciudad. Recomiendo totalmente alojarse  en este barrio.

El apartamento tiene todo lo necesario para pasar unos días en Atenas, está limpio, preparado y la atención al huésped es excepcional. Buena relación calidad/precio. ¡Si volvemos a Atenas, repetiremos! Gracias Dimitris y Yanis :)"
918812,28556072,2015-03-26,14576818,Fabian,"We, a young couple from Berlin, stayed in March for a few days at Dimitris apartment. The apartment was exactly as descriped and very clean. There was everything provided in the apartment - hairdryer, bed linen, towels, coffee, toilet paper, soap, bicycles etc. We didn't get to meet Dimitris but his father gave us a very warm welcome with some fruits, raki, snacks and a suggestion where to eat dinner: this was the best dinner we had in Athens! Thanks a lot for that. We really enjoyed our stay and recommend the apartment for everybody who wants to visit Athens. If we come again to Athens, we would definitely stay in the apartment again, if possible."
918812,28872282,2015-03-31,20892700,Jacy,The listing was completely accurate. Dimitris answered all our questions before arrival and useful information left in flat. Cosy flat with everything we needed. Lovely welcome on arrival. Perfect location for short stay.

Appartamento in posizione strategica a 2 minuti a piedi dall'acropoli, dal tempio di Zeus e dallo stadio (website hidden) ha accolti il gentilissimo papà di Dimitri.
Appartamento essenziale ma pulitissimo.
Se dovessimo tornare ad Atene sceglieremo sicuramente ancora L'appartamento di Dimitri.
Consigliatissimo

Every major sight was no more than a 10min walk, just amazing!! The apartment itself has everything you need, there was even some complimentary croissants and fruit and raki in the fridge for us which was a nice touch "
918812,31940344,2015-05-12,5084780,Justyna,Amazing location. Within walking distance to major tourist attractions. Spacious apartment that had everything that was needed. Dimitris father was very friendly.

A bit unusual that is located on the underground floor, but in general everything is fine. Thank you for chance to see the dreams of ancient Gods ..."
918812,34765963,2015-06-12,12385077,Khiew,Dimitris' father came to meet us at the apartment. He was very lovely and we toasted to some Greek ouzo (I think?). He showed us around and was very detailed and helpful with what we needed in the house. Air-conditioning was good and the place was clean. A very good location 2 minutes away from the Zeus Olympian Temple and a bit more to the Acropolis. We didn't get to meet Dimitris but he was always very quick to respond to our messages and questions. We enjoyed our stay here very very much and would definitely recommend this place. Thank you Dimitris and father!
918812,35127130,2015-06-15,6748874,Federica,"Dimitris and his father are great hosts. Very flexible, precise in providing information and welcoming. The flat is as described in the ad. What I liked the most is definitely the location. Great area, very central & lively."
918812,35446916,2015-06-19,17839376,Kelly,"Our stay at Dimitris apartment was perfect. Dimitris was the most helpful airbnb host, he helped organise us tickets to our next destination which we could not have done without him. He really went above and beyond. The apartment itself was perfectly located, clean and had everything we needed. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to visit Athens. "
918812,35804451,2015-06-22,4398253,Jan,"Everything was great, Dimitris Dad greeted us with a shot of homemade Raki and explained everything in the apartment. He was very welcoming and gave us great tips about the city. He even showed us how to make greek coffee :-).
The apartment itself was spacious enough for 2, very clean and comfortable. The location is absolutely top, almost everything can be reached on foot and if you want to venture further out, there are even 2 bikes for you to use! Totally awesome!"
918812,36169744,2015-06-26,23408905,Pete,Good communication prior to arrival and were met at arranged time. Nice friendly welcome and explanation about the apartment and a traditional drink shared. The apartment was clean with everything you needed on hand. The best thing though is the fantastic location with everything you want to see so easily accessible. would happily return and recommend.
918812,36754709,2015-07-01,10498478,Gerard,"Très bonne location, conforme à la description : un peu sombre et pas luxueuse, mais propre, calme, fonctionnelle, bien équipée ( tout fonctionne ! ) et surtout idéalement située pour les visites et les restaus de Plaka. Dimitris est  tellement attentionné qu'on peut presque arriver dans cet appart les mains dans les poches : serviettes, papiers, 2 bières au frais, 2 croissants pour le 1er petit dej, guide et carte touristiques, 2 vélos les sportifs, parapluies pour les orages, et même un jeu de cartes ... La cuisine est minimaliste, mais suffisante pour quelques repas. Accueil très sympathique de Yannis, le père de Dimitris, qui nous attendait avant même notre appel, qui nous a aidé à garer la voiture et à décharger, qui nous a réservé le taxi pour le retour, et nous a offert l'apéro ! Bref , pour ceux qui ne cherchent pas le grand luxe, un bon rapport qualité/prix, et une location idéale,  à conseiller vivement."
918812,37160666,2015-07-05,19855196,Luis,"My girlfriend and I had a terrific experience on Dimitri's place. The flat is located in the best area a first-timer in Athens could ask for: all the main attractions are within walkable distances. Besides, the place is tidy and cozy, has good wi-fi and everything works just fine. We never had the chance to meet Dimitris, but his father was there to welcome us and answer all our questions with a gentile smile. Surely, I would recommend this place."
240960,2566819,2012-10-09,3724650,Yelena,"This  loft apartment  is stunning. Designed by architect Ioannis Karvoutzis, it is comfortable, spacious and showcases his amazing talents as an architect and interior designer.
It is located in the centre of Psiri, close to Monastiraki Square and within walking distance of Syntagma Square, Plaka and the Acropolis.

Ioannis and his partner Demi were gracious hosts, warm and welcoming and ready to provide advice about the best tavernas, music and bars to explore.

We look forward to staying there again.
"
240960,2607388,2012-10-14,166717,Andrew,"My partner and I spent a fantastic two nights in this Athens apartment. It's a very large, unique and creatively designed space with quirky touches from the vintage furniture to the art on the walls.

It's a straightforward single metro ride from the airport and the station is a short walk away. It's located in a very lively area with bars and cafes on the doorstep and a short walk to shops. We also walked to the trendy Gazi area with more bars and restaurants and the Acropolis Museum and archeological site so it's a very convenient location.

Demi and Ioannis were attentive and welcoming hosts, leaving us refreshments in the flat on arrival and giving us advice on where to go and what to do during our stay.

We'll definitely be staying again the next time we visit this exciting city.
"
240960,3170957,2012-12-28,961751,Noah,This is a gorgeous apartment with a fantastic host in one of my favorites parts of the city. Tons of restaurants and bars and people. Around the corner from public transportation. I highly recommend this apartment for your stay in Athens.
240960,3315095,2013-01-09,961751,Noah,Liked it so much I came back for more!

We will come back soon"

If I come back, for sure I'll go back to Ioannis place"
240960,15193551,2014-07-04,208329,Abigail,"I highly recommend Ioannis' flat for anyone staying in Athens. My traveling companion arrived from another city to check-in to the apartment before me. Even though this complicated things a little for Ioannis, he was perfectly gracious and helpful and made sure everything went smoothly. The apartment itself was clean, stylish, and very quiet---despite being above a lively street in Monastiraki (filled with locals, not tourists). There were 3 of us total, and we were very comfortable. The location is truly the best part; you are a short walk away from great sites, restaurants, metro station, shopping, etc."
240960,15706660,2014-07-14,3588570,Maria,Amazing Apartment! Totally recommended to anyone else to rent it.
240960,15882431,2014-07-17,6091904,Ania,"The apartment was great. So much style that even my 10 and 13 year old kids that it was the coolest place ever! Location was convenient right off of mastriaki square, and steps away from restaurants, shopping, etc. Anna and ioannis were responsive and very friendly. Fantastic experience and would not hesitate to recommend.
"
240960,16557307,2014-07-29,16599788,Ayanthi,The host was very hospitable and understanding as we were running late and got slightly lost! The Apartment was better in person than in the photos. The location couldn't have been better and was walking distance to the Acropolis site and there were lots of bars and restaurants on our doorstop. All in all an excellent experience in an amazing apartment!
240960,16975574,2014-08-05,13230032,Dan Fredrik Clemp,"Ioannis met us at the door when we came and showed us around the apartment. It was clean, well air-conditioned (which was important given the temperature outside) and surprisingly well isolated against outside sounds. It's located in a very busy street with loads of bars and restaurant, yet we barely heard a sound, even with hundreds of people outside.

The apartment in itself is spectacular - I estimate about 100m2 centrally located in Athens, just a short walk from everything we wanted to visit. The interior is what drew me to book the apartment in the first place and it did not disappoint. I think we could have stayed for another week and still keep discovering new things about the furniture, art and details.

I'll definitely book this place again if it's available the next time I'm going to Athens."
240960,17534950,2014-08-13,3299110,Ann,"Great location; convenient.  Spacious apartment; we had three people but the space would have been adequate for more people.  Didn't get a chance to meet Loannis, but he had someone wait for us at the apartment.  Responsive to e-mails."
240960,18128185,2014-08-22,8196346,Yiorgos,"A unique flat in a very convenient location. Very close to the metro and all the happening place of Athens. Spacious and tastefully decorated.
Ioannis was very friendly and put every effort to make our stay pleasant. "
240960,20480959,2014-09-29,1381708,Ramiro,"The apartment is amazing!
It is located in the heart of Athens. Very well connected. Perfect if you want a good location and good atmosphere also at night
Ionnnis has been a great host: he allowed us to leave our bags very early in the morning and let us go on the last day late. It has been very kind and friendly
A perfect choice to spend a few days in Athens."
240960,21635309,2014-10-20,3101308,Stephen,"I had a great stay at Ioannis' Designer Loft in Psirri.
Ioannis was a great host - friendly, easygoing and very hospitable, sometimes going beyond what was expected to make sure my stay was comfortable and that I had everything I needed. As can be seen in the photos, the pad is something a little bit special and definitely very cool but also very comfortable with good facilities a very comfortable bed and everything else I needed - and even an awesome grand piano (which I made full use of!)
The location is A1 - particularly for the young (and young at heart) - right in the middle of Athens' most vibrant entertainment precinct - and also just minutes from Monistariki, Plaka and the ancient ruins of the Acropolis. All great!"
240960,25005134,2015-01-05,12661633,Hiromi,"The apartment was definitely THE highlight of our visit to Athens. It's way better than described or the pictures show. We're still wondering why Ioannis doesn't charge more for this truly unbeatable place... First of all, it's huge. Really huge. Great location. Many restaurants, bars, convenient stores, metro station (Monastiraki), main shopping streets and most of the sights (e.g. Acropolis) within walking distance. The flat is clean and cozy with a tasteful interior design. It offers EVERYTHING you need and even more. I haven't seen any other apartment in Athens but I can promise that this is the best one."
240960,30625971,2015-04-25,30365708,Anton,"5 star loft!!!. Ioannis place is better than advertised. If you are gojng to athens you have to stay here. The loft is better than the pictures provided. You can't get any better than this location. A short walk to Acropolis and all the shopping so close. All the bars and restaurants next door provide a real Greek experience. Ioannis met us as we pulled up and gave a great tour and showed us everything in the flat. Not only was he really friendly he provided water, juice and beer upon arrival, now that is a great host. I highly recommend this place to anybody that wants to have a great time in Athens! Would definitely rent again. Once again, Thanks for a wonderful time."
240960,31724011,2015-05-09,31236648,Cezar,"Excellent value for money !

The apartment is at the second floor of the building but it has two very modern elevators, though quite small (2 persons). It looks just like in the pictures provided on the site - is very large, very comfortable for a couple, and if one wants to use the extensible sofa in the living room, 4-6 persons could easily share the apartment.

If you like to party, you have plenty of space to do it (the living is huge).

The bedroom is large and it has a huge bed that could easily accommodate 4 people.

The kitchen is equipped with everything a family might need (microwave, stove and oven, coffee machine, water kettle, dishes and cutlery, glasses, mugs), and even stocked with ingredients and food (pasta, pasta sauces, honey, jam, butter, coffee, a large variety of teas, juices etc.) - I don't know if Ioannis left them there or they were left by the previous tenants. I appreciated the Jacobs bag of coffee that was ready for the first morning (we arrived late in the night and didn't have time to go for shopping).

The WiFi is free of cost and for those who need it, Ioannis allows his tenants to use his desktop. The speed is high for most of the time. Every now and then, it gets lazy but all you need to do is restart the laptop and/or the switch to get it back to full speed.

The location cannot be better than this - is in the middle of Psirri area of Athens, full of pubs, traditional Greek restaurants, 50 meters from the Monastiraki Metro Station, within 2 minutes walk from the Monastiraki and Plaka areas, 15 minutes walk from Acropolis. It is a bit noisy at night but only if you leave the windows open - if you close them, it's as silent as a church (very well noise proofed). There is a small convenience shop 50 meters away from the apartment which is open 24/7 which makes it very easy to buy water, sodas, juices, coffee, milk, cereals and whatever else you might need.

The apartment has 4 or 5 air conditioning units and a ceiling fan in the bedroom that make it very easy to control the ambient temperature as you wish.

It's one of the few apartments (and very-very few hotels) that offer large LCD TVs (45 to 65 inches), both in the living and in the bedroom, with SATELLITE TVs (in English, French, Italian and Arabic, beside the full list of Greek channels). It takes a good 5 minutes to learn how to use the system but Ioannis is always there to help.

Maybe the most important thing about Designer's Loft is that it made us feel like home in just a few days.

Ioannis is very helpful and prompt and a very discrete host, despite the fact he lives on the same floor. Whatever we asked, we got within minutes (salt, hair dryer)."
240960,32249329,2015-05-16,30244385,Michael,"Wonderful apartment full of character. If you want to be in a lively environment late into the evening , this is a great place to stay. "

The studio is located in an excelent position, near enywhere i needed to be in the city. There are plenty of cafes and bars allaround, a s/m 2' away, plenty of delis and 2 tube stations (Syntagma, University) closeby. And, even though down town Athens, it is very quiet. It seems recently renovated, sufficiently furnished and the rest of the amenities are quite adequate"

The descriptions were really accurate and the place was much better than expected. The location couldn't be better. The apartment is literally in the heart of Athens. Every morning I was opening my window I was enjoying smelling the coffee from the coffee shops downstairs. The area is pretty safe too. Overall, a really nice experience and I am looking forward to visiting the same place soon!! Thank you Klea! "
587782,29505358,2015-04-08,15589601,Chiara,"The property is centrally located, in a small square with bars and cafes, a literary society and a theater. It seems at times somewhat noisy. Cleanliness is ok, the kitchenette is serviceable. Ideal for one person or a couple."
587782,31512361,2015-05-06,2130049,Jane,We did not meet Kleia. The location was wonderful and very convenient to our needs.
587782,32118516,2015-05-14,30121122,Dedra,Klea was always availble to a contact. We had some problem to get to apartment because there is a street with the same name near by! The apartment is central And near everything.The only problem is that the courtain has broken.
587782,32424478,2015-05-17,22093995,Michael,"Athens K. quite flexible with the check-in time and worked with me. Place was exactly as pictured. In the heart of the city center, close to the sites but removed from tourist center. Down the street is a grocery, right below is a cafe with coffee in the morning and beers all night. Quaint yet bustling, I would definitely stay here again. Perfect for one or a couple. "
587782,32813281,2015-05-22,28125482,Henrique,"The location is great and the apartment is nice. Klea was a good and helpfull host, although I did not meet her in person."
587782,33104840,2015-05-25,30561599,Corey,"We never actually met Klea; we had some problems with getting dropped by the cab at the wrong location but we were able to find the place after getting some help from a barista.  We got to the flat during the day and there were directions to get into the building and get inside.  It was a little frustrating to have to get in, I was not getting all of my messages from AirBnB at that time, but Klea was happy to resend the messages and we got in OK.  The flat had pretty good space, and it seems like it is being used just for renting out to people.  One of the window shades was down and the light was pretty bright pretty early in the AM. The washing machine is in the common hallway outside the flat, but we didn't use it.  There are a few quirks to this place, but nothing too difficult.  The location was perfect for us, we wanted to see the local bars and restaurants and the neighborhood is loaded with cafes and bars and places to eat.  The noise would not be great for folks needing to get a lot of sleep and wake up early to hit the sights.  This is a great spot for a younger couple who really want to see what Athens has to offer outside of the touristy sites and locations.  "
587782,33543474,2015-05-29,33859759,Joanna Luying,We spent 3 days there. The location is very good for us to visit sight spots. And the room overall is clean. The only problem is the bar at the ground floor is a little bit noisy at midnight :P
587782,34775798,2015-06-12,3260915,James,"Klea was an excellent host, although we never saw her she provided us with all the info we needed and responded to any questions we had very quickly and thoroughly.
The apartment is very basic but was perfect for what we needed and not bad for the price.
The square that the apartment is located in is bustling at night and this and surrounding immediate radius is brilliant for evening eating and drinking - it draws a young Athenian crowd and we loved it so much we were coming back to this area for evening drinks each night as it was better than anywhere else!
There tends to be a fair amount of noise from the bar below in the evening so all in all I'd say excellent for young people or young couple but perhaps not for those wanting more comfort and quiet. We'd definitely want to stay here again in Athens, walkable to everywhere central and reasonable price.
Make sure you follow Klea's directions from the itinerary not using Google from the rough area AirBnb suggests in order to find it!"
587782,35102923,2015-06-15,29832175,Maya,"This was in a perfect location for exploring Athens (near Monastiraki and Syntagma) and this functional and charming studio apartment had everything we needed, including access to a washing machine. One thing to be aware of is that at night it can get noisy because of local bars/ cafes,  but we really enjoyed the vibe of the neighborhood and felt very safe and comfortable. The space was extremely clean and the host was immediately available for questions and quite accommodating. I would definitely stay again."
587782,35764400,2015-06-22,24236614,Elizabeth,"The apartment and location are great. I did not meet Klea, but she gave me all information I needed by email. "

The flat is incredible - big, equiped with everything needed. we enjoyed it! and Tamara welcomed us so well, helped a lot with different kind of information we needed (eating places; how to get to certain places we needed). the location is  the best - not on the main, loud roads, but exactly parallel of them. and everything is at your fingertips - metro, the main shoping street, and everything else we needed.
everything was amaizing! thank you so much!
sincerely,

1116076,5711145,2013-07-13,1857634,Timo,"A wonderful and big appartment with everything you need right in the center of Athens, two minutes walk to the Monastirakis station with direct connections to Piräus and Athens Airport. 30 minutes walk up to the Akropolis.

But much more important: An absolutely fiendly and warm reception by Tamara who runs the place. Tamara: Thank you, dankeschön and efharistó! It was good to meet you, and I hope we meet again some day.

Regards to Lenka who owns the place: A good selection of books and some very nice Greek music CDs (Theodorakis, Marinella, Katzis).

Thanks for having us! All the best, Timo"

Super accueil plein de prévenance de Tamara. Si j'ai l'occasion de revenir à Athènes, je n'hésiterai pas à reprendre contact."
1116076,6289932,2013-08-06,105924,Dr. Carroll,this beautiful 1937 apartment is very unusual for athens and with german dark bread and berlin crossed with melbourne style decor it was just perfect for us.

1116076,10178972,2014-02-04,3277778,Lindaura,"I guess number one is that Lenka and Tamara are wonderful to deal with. Pleasant, intelligent and helpful.
The flat is fantastic for several reasons, again, the main one being its location if the centre of the city of Athens, but amazingly quiet, for being a stroll away from everything you would want to see.
It is in the Monastiraki section of Athens, really part of the Plaka and all the old markets, the Acropolis looming on the hill just down the pedestrian lane from the flat.
This is a first floor flat in an old, Deco building, with a charming balcony.  There is no lift, but it is an easy walk up the beautiful white marble staircase.
The flat is huge, with a large well equipped kitchen, big double bedroom, two other rooms that adjoin each other, with single beds in them, more vestibules than you can shake a stick at, a living room, one bathroom with toilet as well as a small separate WC, a service room and balconies galore.
The flat is perfect, the location amazing, and the two women exceedingly (website hidden): Athens is a great city!"

1116076,14783549,2014-06-26,1488176,Karine,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a great location downtown for our short stay in Athens. This was the perfect spot. We walked easily by foot to Acropolis, Plaka, Psiri and and Thisio and really optimized our short time to visit the city. We couldn't have been more well located in Athens. The apartment is really big and clean. Maria also bought us some yogurt and bread for our breakfast which was really nice. There is also a yoga mat you can use to relax after a long day. Maria helped us get a taxi to get the airport which was really helpful for us. I would come back any time for my next stay in Athens!"
1116076,15704223,2014-07-14,3122104,Amandine,"Lenka and Tamara's place is the perfect place to stay in Athens. It's located in the center of Athens, close to la Plaka (the most pleasant area of Athens) and to the metro station Monastriraki (very central, you can even go directly to the airport from that station).

The apartment is extremely clean, spacious and pleasant (mostly the balcony!!).

Tamara was a very kind host, she even agreed to let me stay one more night without any problem.

If I come back to Athens, I would pick this place for sure!! I couldn't have found better!! "
1116076,16038681,2014-07-20,12964469,Curtis,"This is a truly amazing apartment. If it is available for your dates you should request to book without hesitation. It is huge, perfectly located, and the hosts are exceptionally organized. The flat is immaculately clean and everything was exactly as described. It was even bigger than we expected based on the photos and descriptions, and we fell in love with the neighborhood -- it is on a quiet street just off of a major pedestrian area filled with shops, cafes and restaurants that don't feel touristy at all, yet you can walk to the Acropolis in 10 minutes. Communication with Lenka and Tamara was easy and they have prepared a huge information packet to make you feel welcome. The kitchen, bathroom and even the laundry are well supplied, so you have all the essentials you need to make your stay as easy as it can be. I'm not sure there's a better value to be had in Athens."
1116076,17562259,2014-08-14,11910782,Fabiano,"The apartment was spacious, full furnished and very confortable. The flat position is just perfect to visit Athens. Tamara has been homely and friendly. Highly recommended!"

1116076,20097579,2014-09-23,20107886,Nadia,"l appartamento è di circa 110 mq e si trova al 1mo piano di un immobile di 3 piani nell area di Plaka. L a cucina è fornita di ogni elettrodomestico , di pentole nuove e di generi alimentari di prima necessità. Per l 'ubicazione, per l arredamento, per i servizi, per la pulizia il prezzo di 50 euro al giorno per 4 persone in settembre è basso. L appartamento, molto ventilato e silenzioso, si trova a circa 250 mt. dalla stazione metro di Monastiraki da cui si può raggiungere sia l'aeroporto che il porto del Pireo. A 200mt  dalla stazione metro si trova l'ingresso all'area archeologica. A 300mt.,  verso piazza Omonia, si trova il maggiore mercato al pubblico per pesce, il mercato delle carni, il mercato della frutta e della verdura in cui i prezzi sono più bassi che altrove. C è anche un supermercato Carrefour. L appartamento si trova  in una via silenziosa situata pochi metri dietro  la zona di caffè, trattorie, disco-bar, aperti sino all'alba. Inoltre la zona di Monastiraki è piena di negozi di abbigliamento,  di souvenir di ogni genere , di robivecchi. L area di Plaka in cui nell'Atene dell epoca d'oro hanno camminato Solone, Socrate, Platone, Pericle Euripide, Sofocle,Fidia ecc. è senz alcun dubbio  la migliore in cui risiedere per alcuni giorni. L'host abita di fronte all appartamento ed è molto disponibile.   "
1116076,20759112,2014-10-05,20169847,David,"Great location next to pedestrian street that leads you straight to the Acropolis.

It is a wonderfully large apartment with all the necessities. If you are visiting Athens, you can not beat this location. There is a market two blocks away and tons of shopping in the area.

About two blocks from the subway and an easy walk to all the great sites.

We really liked the place and would stay again."

The flat was comfortable and there was plenty of space for our family of four, although the two single beds were seriously ""sunken in the middle"" according to both my adult son and daughter who slept in them (the double bed was fine). We very much enjoyed the location of the flat -- close to the metro, cafés and restaurants, minimarts and shops, and an easy walk to the Acropolis. "

1116076,27246378,2015-03-01,23863107,Monica,Wij vonden de locatie geweldig. Midden in een levendige buurt met leuke restaurantjes en dichtbij de markt. Musea en de acropolis op loopafstand. Het appartement was heel fijn. Een grote keuken met genoeg basisvoorzieningen. De grote slaapkamer heeft een lekker bed. En een gezellige huiskamer waar je lekker op de bank kunt zitten. En die goed te verwarmen is als het buiten nat en koud is.
1116076,27490172,2015-03-06,23367939,Bobby,"The flat proved an excellent choice for a 4 night stay in Athens.
It's a 5 minute walk from the main square & although we found it to be a little noisy on occasion at night time, slept well & enjoyed the  bars & restaurants in the surrounding area, which is friendly & not as tourist focused as the very centre of the city.
The flat is spacious, well equipped & very comfortable. A home from home.

Communication was easy & handled in a courteous & efficient way.

1116076,31876496,2015-05-11,27395461,Iris,"Het appartement is perfect qua locatie, ruimte en sfeer. We hebben alles lopend in Athene bekeken vanuit het appartement. De locatie is centraal maar juist net niet heel toeristisch wat het ontspannen en interessanter maakt. Probeer vooral de wraps van de overbuurman. Het balkon is geweldig. Wij hebben er elke keer gegeten. Het huis is super schoon en van alle gemakken voorzien. Het tweepersoonsbed is het lekkerste bed dat we hebben gehad van onze 6 locaties in Griekenland. De kinderen sliepen op de twee bedden in de meditatieruimte en vonden deze ook heerlijk slapen. Het welkom was warm en hartelijk. Tamara stond ons buiten op te wachten zodat we niet hoefden te zoeken naar de ingang. Ze had duidelijke praktische informatie over de metro en waar we supermarkten konden vinden. Ik kan niet anders zeggen dan een aanrader. Fijn dat Lenka en Tamara ons zo de mogelijkheid hebben gegeven om Athene op een relaxte manier te ontdekken. Het was een mooie afsluiting van onze rondreis."
1116076,32460847,2015-05-18,28042417,Hye Rim,"Great host & apartment!!!

My family of 4 full adults stayed at the apartment.

Our host, Tamara was so kind that she welcomed us even at our late arrival at 24:00 hour!! She also gave us  helpful information about surroundings.

Her apartment was clean, spacious for my family and had everything we could think of: washing machine, hair dryer, various spicies for cooking, etc. The apartment is located at the very center of the city and many tourist spots are in walkable distance. At the same time, since it is located at the center, it could be a bit noisy at night though it didn't last whole night.

I would definitely book her apartment if I get to go Athens again."
1116076,32835417,2015-05-22,31024452,Kelli,Unfortunately we had some travel mishaps that made us miss a night.  We really only were there long enough for a quick sleep and an early morning departure.  The beds were comfortable and the space was nice :)
1116076,33248123,2015-05-26,7975086,Anne,"Tamara was quick to respond to our texts and calls. We found the apartment just as expected, in the perfect location for us, with yogurt waiting in the frig -- just the thing my pregnant daughter craved!
The directions and notes on the apartment and neighborhood were all accurate and thoughtful. We couldn't be happier with our stay! There was an electrical malfunction, and Tamara located an electrician on a Saturday afternoon who came and repaired things promptly. Much appreciated!"
1116076,34127811,2015-06-05,29863818,Patty,"This apartment was even bigger than we thought it would be, and Tamara had yogurt, milk and juice in the fridge for us. The washer and dryer were also a treat! The location is excellent - right in the middle of a terrific area but not right on the busiest streets. There are excellent restaurants and bars just a block away. It was a little tricky for the taxi to find the location, so public transportation is probably the best way to access the space. My adult children noted that there's an excellent CD selection, and I enjoyed the spare guide books left from previous visitors. "
1116076,35536468,2015-06-20,25927819,Frédérique,"We really loved our stay in Lenka & Tamara's place. It was very clean, very well equiped and very nicely furnished. The good surprise was the size of the rooms : really big and spacious with and XL bed in the main bedroom. Though the flat has no air conditionning, it was cool enough thanks to the numerous fans.
The location is also perfect : very close to everything (pedestrian shopping street, Plaka, Acropolis) so it's possible to come down for an hour or two, come back to the flat to rest and get away from the heat and got out again later when it's cooler.
Last good point : the very good and very cheap place to eat downstairs, at the corner of the street. "

The terrace is simply amaaazing! It's like a botanic garden in the middle of the city!
House's location is perfect because you can move around the center (Akropoli, Monastiraki, Plaka) on foot. There is a metro station really close to the house so i didn't have to spend extra money for transport.
In the future i will definitely stay here again!!!"
1824675,8708592,2013-11-12,6540848,Katrina,"Me and my boyfriend were very lucky to stay with Christos. The appartement is in a really nice location between different cool areas (both the tourist attractions and new upcoming areas) and close to different public transport stops. Especially cool was that the Filopapou hill was just a few minute away from his home and it was nice to go jogging there in the evening. Perfect view to the Acropolis and the whole town.

The place had great energy, the room was nice and clean, the bed comfy and the house had a cool terrace. The people living there were very zen :).

Definitely recommend! A great way to meet the locals but also have enough privacy."
1824675,8747575,2013-11-15,1507715,Stefanie,Cristos is very nice and easy to get along with. He is quick to answer your questions and always willing to help - he even picked us up from the metro the first day we arrived because it was a huge thunderstorm/downpour and drove us back to his place. Then he fed us dinner since it never stopped raining really hard and we had no food/no idea where to go look for food. The room we stayed in was also very large and warm. Wi-Fi worked great. All around very good place within a 10-15 min walk to the acropolis and agora.

The room was clean and had great sunlight, was really spacious and comfortable.
Christos was a great host. We enjoyed a lot out chats with him and the little details we had were more than what we expected. He gave us a map the day we arrived and a desert he had prepared.
He was really helpful and a really great host. We surely recommend this place both due the location and the human kindness of the host. "

The room is in first floor,  clean and wide with small balcony, double size bed is comfortable. He keeps very clean and tidy to kitchen, bathroom and living room.
The great host Christos who is so helpful , kindly and gently as a host and humanity is wonderful, has sensible, considerate.  Also he has many good friends, they are very friendly and kindly too. I really enjoyed and got many lovely and cheerful memories by Christos and them. I am missing after left from his home, and want to go back to his home one day.
I really recommend you his home for staying in Athens.You must be able to know and feel what heartwarming and good hospitality, pleasant character of Greek. "

We enjoyed the accomodations in the center of the city: pleasant room in a big house with an amazing terrace! I keep a very kind memorie of the host. Christos was always ready to help us how it works in Athen to go with the metro or on foot. The house was in a very pleasant district: quiet and easy to find tavernas or nice bars. I liked particularly the proximity with the beautiful parc Filopappou."
1824675,10469548,2014-02-20,10972318,Jerry,"Delightful host and sufficient privacy - no surprises, all just as advertised."

Christos was very kind to me and invited me to enjoy a barbeque party on the roof with his friends. Apperently a yearly grill party in Athens ""smokey thursday"" (loosly translated). But it was great!
"
1824675,10751197,2014-03-05,8371079,Deise,"Christos is a very nice and kind host. His house is in a good location, near by a lot of bars and restaurants. You'll have a beautiful view of the Acropolis while you'll be walking around :)

1824675,10798977,2014-03-08,11179046,Hilary,"We were sad that we only had one night to stay in Athens and at Cristos. The room was geeat big and clean. Cristos was awesome, so helpful and easy to contact. Helped us with everything. Location was great as well. Loved our stay. Thank you!"

1824675,11164018,2014-03-23,2998999,Eli,"This was a really great place exactly as advertised. Christos made sure he was home to welcome me, and gave me great advice about places to eat, but was really unintrusive for the rest of the stay. It felt like my girlfriend and I had the place all to ourselves, and this was really great. For the price you pay for this place, you really get an amazing deal. Highly recommend."
1824675,11244602,2014-03-26,5074434,Alexander,"Christos is a great hoist, helpful, respectful, interesting and easy going. I stayed 3 nights. The room is big, bright, clean and has a comfortable huge bed. And the house is close to 2 metro stations (I used) representing lively neighbourhoods of Thissio and Keramikos. Would highly recommend, plus there's a great roof top terrace too. Thanks Christos."

1824675,11584792,2014-04-08,2672639,Lis,"we really had a great time!
christos is the perfect host:  a very open person, friendly and always wanting to help, we are really thankful for that. the room is charming and the flat is in a great location, a beautiful neighborhood and still near to the main points in athen.

1824675,11949075,2014-04-20,11539134,Meneka,"I stayed in Athens with Christos for one week, and the room was perfect. Christos was very friendly and met me at the metro station to take me to the house. I was interested in learning about Greek food, and he showed me how to make some typical dishes and was kind enough to share it with me. The house is about a 15 minute walk from the center and fairly close to 2 metro stations. The room is spacious and clean. I highly recommend it!"
1824675,12166622,2014-04-24,14341747,Allie,"Our stay with Christis was great. He picked us up from the airport for 35€ and once we got to his flat he spent about 30 minutes helping us map out our trip and orienting us to the area. He even let us borrow his map for the duration of our stay.

Space is exactly as pictured. The rooftop patio is great. Bedroom was private and very clean. Bathroom is shared with all flatmates but there is a second toilet right next to the main bathroom if needed.

Flat is within walking distance to great restaurants and all tourist attractions.

Christos was very kind and helpful throughout our entire trip. Would absolutely recommend his flat! "
1824675,12400587,2014-05-01,12956072,Christine,"The room and the neighborhood was exactly as described. It was very close to the city center, the room/the whole flat was clean and pleasant. It was very nice staying there. Christos gave us all the informations we needed and was very helpful. We were spending some hours on his terrace - a perfect end of our greece vacation. "
1824675,12450902,2014-05-03,8070429,Nicola,"The room is good, even if during the night some motos or cars can disturbe who has a light sleep like me. Christos has been very kind and helpful in everything I needed.
I advise him and his house!"
1824675,12688473,2014-05-08,868858,Kunal,"Christos was amazing, he gave me clear directions for the public transit even mentioning little details like which direction to exit so that he could escort us to his Apartment. Yes, he was waiting outside the station.

Throughout our stay, he was generous with his time, food and advice. And one of the days, he even cooked an amazing beef and vegetables dish. Apparently it was his first attempt. It worked, it was delicious.

The room is nice and large, and while the bathroom is shared with the other roommates, it was super clean. There is a bunch of road noise, so bring ear plugs and you'll sleep well.

I cannot say enough about the location, you can walk everywhere from the Akropolis, Flea Market, Syntagma Square, Temple of Zeus within about 10-20 minutes from the apartment."
1824675,12755262,2014-05-10,14239309,Caroline,"Christos was very welcoming and willing to answer all of our questions. My sister and I greatly enjoyed staying in this neighborhood--it was quiet and safe as well as within walking distance to the metro station, restaurants, the Acropolis, and various other sites. The room was exactly as it appeared online and the apartment as a whole was comfortable and clean. We would definitely recommend staying with Christos while in Athens!"
1824675,12778031,2014-05-11,2222758,Miriam,"Christos and I had a little misunderstanding about the time I was arriving, however I immediately got through to him on mobile phone and we sorted it out. I did not manage to stay in the room in the listing so I cannot review that. However I did stay in another room in the same apartment. The apartment is sweet with lots of light and a cute roof garden. The area of the apartment is great to visit the sites on foot, being a few minutes away from Filopappou hill, Roman Agora, Monastiraki market and other places of interest. Christos was helpful, friendly and accommodating. Thank you!"
1824675,12850274,2014-05-12,5703726,Elsa,"Christos et son colocataire ont été très accueillants avec nous, alors que nous arrivions tard. Lit très confortable dans un grand appartement, situé dans un quartier très sympa pour sortir. Idéalement situé pour nous qui venions du Pirée et qui allions le lendemain à l'aéroport. Seul inconvénient : le bruit de la route juste à côté !"
1824675,12906574,2014-05-13,15068307,Dave,"Christos is a great host! He gave us great tips for seeing Athens and also his local neighborhood, which is not very touristy and very fun and local. We also hung out with Christos on his beautiful patio and jammed out on his bouzouki.   Had a great time. The place is quiet, private and clean. Two thumbs up!"
1824675,12968786,2014-05-16,11515155,Diane,"This was a great place to stay. It's a nice residential area with an easy and scenic walk (over the hill) to the Acropolis/central Athens. The room is spacious, with a place to hang up clothes, and it was good to have access to a bathtub. The roof garden is especially pleasant; a lovely place to relax. Christos is very welcoming and helpful. I would definitely stay here again!"
1824675,13207244,2014-05-22,12125173,Carola,"Christos welcomed us on arrival with a coffee and conversation on his rooftop garden.

1824675,13307811,2014-05-25,920662,Sven,"I had a great time at Christos' flat. He is so nice and welcoming, the flat has a fantastic roof garden, the only thing that is sad is that I only spent one day at his place."
1824675,13346542,2014-05-26,8184702,Brandy,"Christos was a knowledgeable and accommodating host. He walked to the Metro station to pick us up, recommended nearby restaurants and places for us to go, and gave us a well drawn out map of Athens. The room itself was enough for the 2 of us. It was hot when we stayed there so we kept the windows open. You will hear traffic if you do that, since it's a somewhat busy street but it didn't bother us. The location is in a non-touristy area so you're guaranteed to see the daily lives of Athens. Also a short walking distance (about 15 at a brisk walking pace) from the footpath leading to the Acropolis where there are a few pretty/romantic restaurants/bars.

Thank you for your accommodation Christos!"
1824675,13495489,2014-05-28,9599740,Phil,"Christos est super serviable extrêmement sympa et acceuillant. L'appartement,propre et spacieux,est très bien situé, à quelques minutes de 2 lignes de métro,de super restos et de bars sympas.
Gazi,techonopolis,l'Acropole ou encore Monastriaki sont accessible a pied et cerise sur le gateau, le genial toit terrasse est l'endroit parfait pour commencer ou finir la journée.

Gazi, techonopolis, Acropolis or Monastriaki are accessible by foot and icing on the cake, the brilliant roof terrace is the perfect place to start or end the day."
1824675,13781202,2014-06-04,11905329,Valerie,Our stay could not have gone better. His welcoming warmth made the entire trip that much better and it was helpful to have a thoughtful person to show such kindness in such a big city. His attention to detail (from fresh sheets to folded laundry) was spectacular and much appreciated. We would recommend him to any tourist or traveler in Athens.
1824675,13845003,2014-06-06,11528218,Suki,"Christos is an amazing host. He picked us up from the metro station, provided all we need for exploring Athens. The house is close to Acropolis and other attractions by 15mins walk. The room was nice and spacious but close to the street that you can hear a little bit noise in the morning but it's ok for us. We only stayed for one night but still highly recommend this. Thank you Christos!!"

Very close to the Acropolis and Christos was very helpful with directions and advice on negotiating Athens. Christos is friendly and so are his other friends. His rooftop garden is an excellent way to relax. Apart from some noise from the street, this is an excellent place to stay while in Athens. Thanks Christos for a great stay."
1824675,14673274,2014-06-23,2712072,Eva,"Great location to walk to the Acropolis, restaurants, shopping. Also a close walk to the Metro although we only needed the train to get to and from the airport. Christos was really fun to be around, and very helpful. He felt like an old friend. Enjoy his rooftop garden and if you have the opportunity to hang out with and eat with him, don't turn it down- he is a great person and an excellent cook! "
1824675,14744625,2014-06-25,14722025,Nathan,"We stayed with Christos for two nights after spending two weeks in the Greek islands and loved it.  Christos generously met us early when our ferry came in an hour early and took the time to help us throughout our stay. We had a late afternoon flight the second day and he let us keep our stuff there and relax until we had to leave for our flight.  The location is great and the roof garden is excellent.  Would highly recommend -- Christos is funny, kind, and generous."
1824675,15076027,2014-07-01,17083102,Ted,Christos was an excellent host! This trip was my first visit to Athens and my first time traveling in Europe alone. Christos gave me very specific directions on how to meet him from the airport and even took the time to meet me at the metro station. He knows the city quite well and gave me some great advice on where to go for the best view of the sights as well as amazing places to eat. His flat is very spacious and very pretty. He has a garden on his roof deck and is always up for a relaxing afternoon there with good food and drink. I can safely say that Christos helped me to make the most of my time in Athens!
1824675,15111654,2014-07-02,3710391,Teona,"Christos was kind and helpful.  He met me at the Metro station. I arrived after dark so it would have been difficult to find his house without him.  The place was clean and comfortable, though everything quite basic.  The roof terrace a big plus and his house a short walk (20mins?) through the park to the Acropolis. I'd stay there again."
1824675,15168854,2014-07-04,5103447,Erik,"You feel at home with Christos, down to earth tradidional appartment, with nice green roof where you can have your breakfast and wine in the evening. Orginal Athens neigbourhood, you don't miss the tourist here and you can walk tot the Acropolis. We love'd it."

Christos is a kind, laid-back and attentive host. He was very accommodating and we enjoyed our time here. We only wish that we had brought some ear plugs as the noise from occasional speeding cars was very loud. Nevertheless, we slept well. "
1824675,15670373,2014-07-14,13263268,Alejandra,"We had a great time at Christos. He is very easy going and helpful, our flight arrive really late at night and he offer to pick us at the airport. The place is located in a very nice neighborhood, walking distance to the acropolis and has great views of the moon from the roof garden. "
1824675,16120488,2014-07-22,382828,Luke & Joni,Christos was a fantastic host! The place was conveniently located close to the historical centre of Athens with lots of attractions nearby.

1824675,16294609,2014-07-25,12810664,Lalitha,"We spent 2 nights at Christos' apartment. He was very nice and even met us at the metro station. He gave us a map and told us what attractions we should go to. His apartment was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was clean. There was a lot of noise at night from the street though but it was okay if you shut the windows. The door of the room is also tricky to handle. His apartment is in a good location and a 20 minute walk to the Akropolis. Overall, I would definitely recommend Christos' apartment. It was a great experience."
1824675,16379324,2014-07-26,5024903,Guillaume,"Excellent journey at Christo's! Very nice welcome, great house, good bedroom, very convenient location. The district is very nice and close to everything.

The apartment conveniently located and  is well within walking distance of all the major historical sites in Athens. The room and facilities are more than adequate and the added rooftop patio is a huge bonus (it's sooo nice up there)!

Pros:
Conveniently located
Comfortable Room
Excellent Host

He was able to accommodate all three of us and even picked my sister up from the airport and welcomed me and my other sister at the metro station. The neighborhood has great restaurants, and an outdoor cinema, and is within walking distance to two metro lines, grocery stores, etc... And it was a quick walk thru the park to get to the Acropolis, so perfect!
His home is beautiful and very comfortable. The three of us fit perfectly in our room, with an adorable balcony to the street. His rooftop garden is so pretty and relaxing, it’s a great place to chill out and beat the heat.
Christos was the perfect host, relaxed, intelligent, and has a great sense of humor. He was very accommodating; offering us Greek coffee, maps and useful information about the city on our arrival.  Christos goes above and beyond for his guests - several times he looked up bus information and was always available and willing to answer all of our questions.
We had planned to rent a car for a day trip but didn’t realize how expensive it was, Christos offered for a fee to take us on a car ride down the coast to Lake Vouliagmeni and to Cape Sounion, it was breathtaking. We also had the best meal of our lives with Christos and his wonderful friends, seriously we still dream about that food, highlight of our trip!!  Christos truly made our trip to Greece such a special and meaningful experience and oh yea, FUN! Thx Christos!!!
"

3) host: Christos is a lovely host, helped us on how to get around, sat with us and had a chat, made us feel welcome, was nice and super easy to get along with

I agree with all other reviews including the  only negative point others have mentioned - which is the traffic noise, mainly motorcycles using the one way street close to the room. Having said this I slept OK despite the noise. The room is big, the bed comfortable and I found the desk and chair to be very useful."
1824675,19408335,2014-09-12,5774488,Philippa,"We had a fantastic time at Christos' place. The room is clean and spacious and Christos is a generous host - letting us help ourselves to breakfast and food in the cupboards!

The flat is close to local bars, cafes and restaurants which had a great atmosphere and its a short walk into the centre of Athens/Acropolis etc too!"

He was extremely helpful in helping me navigate my way around Athens to find things I needed for a workshop I attended.  His flat is specious with a beautiful roof garden, kept very clean, transportation is excellent as it is near the metro and the neighborhood. shopkeepers are friendly.  I was invited to share the aromatic meals Christos prepared.  He was an excellent host .  I I was very comfortable at Christos and would not hesitate to recommend it."

Thanks Christos, Dimitri and Thanos"

We enjoyed the beautiful weather in Athens and had a great location to discover the sites.  Christos' place was clean with a very private area below for guests.  He also has a great rooftop garden that can be accessed and enjoyed.  He had great hospitality and respects his guest's privacy.  Overall, our experience was a wonderful one."
1824675,22028922,2014-10-28,3501710,Rozlynn And Russell,Christos was great.  We took advantage of his offer of a pick up at the airport and it made are welcome to Athens perfect.  The flat and our room was spacious comfortable and exactly as pictured.  Christos had a map for us and directions to a nearby grocery store and many fine neighborhood restaurants.  We spent three days walking to all the sights around ancient Athens from the flat.
1824675,22067589,2014-10-29,20912567,Daniela,"Christos was a wonderful host.  He picked us up from the airport (for 35 euro) and drove us right to his place.  No hassle.  Unfortunately,  we only could stay in Athens one night but Christos made sure to show us the map and how to get to the attractions we wanted to see the next morning.  Super close to Acropolis.  Beautiful apartment.  No need to stay anywhere else!"
1824675,22125436,2014-10-30,16297655,Léah,"Christos was a very welcoming person, most pleasant to talk to. He is relaxed, happy to help and to provide information.
The flat is well located, with a pleasant walk throuh a park to access the Acropolis and other places of interest in Athens. It is between two or three stations, within a 10 to 15 minutes walk range.

It is also very clean, and the room is vast with additional couches. It may be a little noisy but earplugs were kindly provided.

We would definitely stay there again. "
1824675,22367775,2014-11-04,21849853,Mauricio,"The place was really good! The bedroom was huge and it was located in a perfect area.If you want you can walk to the acropolis or you can take the subway because there is a close station. Christos is really nice, he helped us with everything and he is really friendly, thank you!! I recommend this place."
1824675,22742958,2014-11-13,5201377,Lucy,"Got to Greece and Christos kept in touch with me and offered to pick me up. I decided because I had a lot of luggage that a taxi would be better off and didn't want to bother Christos. The taxi instead charge me a lot more than he was supposed to, double the price... That's ok. I now learned I need to accept when a host kindly offers something. I got into his place and we sat down and talked for a while about lots of things and he made me tea. He also shared dinner with me which was so nice and so good!  He's a very chill guy who respects your space and doesn't bother you if you don't want to be bothered. One of the nights, I wanted more sleep and de didn't make any noise. He has lots of things available for you and if he doesn't have it, he offers to find it.

Christos was already going to be a host to someone else for the rest of my trip, so I at least got to be with him for a short period of time and I'm glad I did. He gave me directions on how to get places. We sat down and talked about places I definitely should visit based on what kind of things I like. He even kept in touch with my next airbnb host to have me move out comfortably. Christos is a great host! Thank you for opening your doors to me. By the way, you have to go to his rooftop and check out the things he has made... Really sweet!"
1824675,23012224,2014-11-20,19383964,Scott,"Christos was a great host.  He was pretty much always available and more than happy to share suggestions and give advice, as well as talk about things in general.  His home is clean and quiet and just as described on airbnb.  I especially enjoyed the rooftop garden, which is very private, spacious and very large.  The Acropolis and Plaka nightlife area is an easy 15-20 minute walk and there are plenty of restaurants, and cafes within a five minute walk of Christos place.  I would gladly stay here again."
1824675,23179999,2014-11-24,1140097,Cristian,"My days in Athens were absolutely perfect. Christos waited for me at the Metro Station, gave me detailed information (while we were having Greek coffee) and then he helped me reach every point in the city. Christos is an extremely interesting man, we talked a lot about the country and he was always willing to help me navigate Athens.

The room he has, is well located and HUGE. Really big and cozy. There is a supermarket down the street and I felt home -i would say- from day 1.

The neighborhood is quiet and safe. You can walk easily and be right in front of Akropolis in 15 minutes. Actually, you can go to a lot of archeological sites from Christo's home within 30 minutes walking.

I would definitely recommend Christos as a host when visiting Athens. He makes the whole trip worth it from day 1. "
1824675,23330253,2014-11-29,17508078,Diva,"Christos is an incredible host -  friendly, helpful and a real gentleman! He helped us with our luggage from the metro station, gave us an orientation to the city, shared his food with us, dropped us to the airport - you just couldn't ask for a better host!

The apartment is also close (walking distance) to the Acropolis and other major sights, and there are many lively bars and restaurants nearby.

The room is neat, clean, well maintained and Christos takes care of everything. There's also a heater to warm you up, if you feel cold in the winter. The only drawback is that the room faces a noisy street. If you are a light sleeper, you can hear cars and motorcycles go by every few minutes until late in the night. Christos has thoughtfully provided ear plugs, so those help a little.

Other than that, its a perfect place, and I highly recommend it!"
1824675,23413031,2014-11-30,5999143,Leonor,Christos came to meet me at the subway station and walked me home. Additionally he also recommended a good restaurant in the neighbourhood and walked me there too :) He had all kind of maps and tips ready to guide me which helped me feel very welcome and at home. Thanks!
1824675,24227025,2014-12-23,22588464,Guillermo,"NOS FUE A ESPERAR A LA ESTACIÓN DEL METRO. SIEMPRE ESTUVO ATENTO A NUESTRA LLEGADA. LO OFRECIDO RESPONDIÓ A LA REALIDAD. EL VECINDARIO ES UN POCO RUIDOSO, PERO NADA EXTREMO."
1824675,24303601,2014-12-25,4730590,Benedetta,"Christos is a warm, friendly person and was a great host during our stay. The house is a nice, comfy, rather bohemian place. The beds are comfortable, the house was well-heated (December) the shared kitchen is well-stocked and there is a fantastic rooftop patio. We could walk to the Parthenon and museum (a pleasant walk through neighborhoods and the park) and there were cafes and bars nearby.
There's a shared kitchen and bathroom and living area so there is a sense of community-but the room is private enough that we had enough privacy too. Not fancy but warm, welcoming and I'd definitely stay here again We are two adults and three teens and we had a great time. He even shared his recipe for Greek Lentils."
1824675,24588137,2014-12-31,10293546,Gianmaria,"I visited Athens with my girlfriend from 26th December to 31st December 2014.
Christos picked us up at Kerameikos Metro Station. We got home in 10-15 minutes. His
house is situated in a very strategic location not far from Akropolis area. The neighbourhood is quiet and pleasant.
Christos' house is nice, spacious, clean and functional. Our accommodation was perfect. We had a large bedroom (with two bright windows, a piece of furniture with several drawers, a large desk, an electric heater and a useful coat rack) plus a living room annexed with another window with a small table and two couches.  In addition, there's a large and cozy terrace where we would have our breakfast surrounded by several houseplant and pot plants.
Christos is a very pleasant guy.
He’s careful, discreet and, most of all, very kind. He cooked for us twice and I must say he's a very good cook too.
The night before we left we had a wonderful dinner together talking about everything in a very friendly atmosphere.
I'm very happy I've made the pleasure of his acquaintance and if I ever came back to Athens I'd surely contact him.
In conclusion, strongly recommended.
"
1824675,25104433,2015-01-06,3726286,Neria,"Abbiamo incontrato Christos alla metropolitana, molto gentilmente ci ha (website hidden) verso casa e accolto con un caffè e suggerimenti sulla città, piccoli accorgimenti, le ciabatte per casa, un ombrello in caso di pioggia, il termosifone nella stanza ci hanno piacevolmente stupito.
Christos si è rivelato un host molto discreto ma presente.
La posizione della casa veramente ottima, in pochissimo tempo si raggiungono tutti i siti di maggior interesse ed è vicinissima alla metropolitana.
La stanza dove siamo stati ospitati molto grande e con possibilità di utilizzo di un salotto, un po' rumorosa per via della strada adiacente, ma sopportabile. Pulizia ottima.
"
1824675,25185266,2015-01-08,25459349,Nat,"Christos met us at the metro station and walked us to his apartment. It was warm and clean, exactly what we wanted! He made us our first Greek coffees and explained everything we needed to know for the next day.

Unfortunately, we did no see him again during our next day and a half in Athens, perhaps because we had different schedules than him.
All in all, great place, great location and very nice host. "
1824675,25409667,2015-01-15,17314448,Isaac,"Staying at Christos' place was a pleasure, and really enhanced our trip. When we arrived  in Athens we were a little lost, but after we gave Christos a call he tracked us down and led us to the room. He then offered us a map of the city to borrow and highlighted good areas to explore and eat, answering all of our questions. When my brother asked about the outlet situation Christos offered to go out and buy us a converter. In summary -- he made us feel very welcome!

The place where we stayed was very clean, comfortable and spacious, as well as nicely decorated. We visited in the Winter so it got cold at nights but there was heating and a radiator so we slept well. The adjacent room to the bedroom had some couches and extra blankets. The neighborhood and the building are pretty quiet at night, which makes this a good place to relax.

At the same time, the location of the room is really ideal, right in the heart of Athens. Walk outside and down the street for a few minutes and you find yourself climbing up towards Filopappous Hill, a spot where you get great views of the city, and especially the Acropolis a few minutes away. It's an easy walk to the Acropolis, the Plaka, Psirri, Monastiraki, Syntagma Square, and all those other great destinations. Nearby are metro stops from the Airport (blue line) and towards the port at Piraeus (green line), where you can go to catch a ferry to an island.

If you're looking for a very reasonably priced and comfortable room centrally located in Athens, I recommend you stay with Christos!"
1824675,25791615,2015-01-26,24280126,Asrizal,"We arrived in Athens at 7.30pm and Christos was kind enough to help us guide the taxi driver as he doesn't know the area.

Once arrived, he helped carry our heavy luggages up the apartment. Room was spacious. Clean sheet, fresh towels. Christos showed us map to attractions around Athens especially Acropolis area.

In short, it was nothing but good experience. Highly recommended for anyone looking to stay in Athens!"
1824675,25881062,2015-01-28,25647469,Sofía,"Our stay at Christos' house was amazing, he's a really nice guy and extremely helpful, he picked us up at the station, helped with our bags, gave us everything we needed. He even helped us when our clothes got wet because there was a really heavy storm in Athens. The room is soo confortable and warm, the whole appartment was nicely decorated and clean, we could enjoy our time in Christos living room next to the fire talking or eating (a lot!). We tasted greek cheese and lettuces thanks to our host and learned a lot about the greek way of life and their hospitality. Although Christos was always there to give us directions or sharing with us, he also respected our privacy. We had a really great time, we totally recommend him as a host and we are willing to come back some day. Thanks for everything Christos!!!"
1824675,26181796,2015-02-06,25508933,Sharon,"Christos was an amazing host. He was kind, generous and warm. We felt extremely welcome in his home. Before we even arrived, Christos went out of his way to send us any and all information that would make our navigating in Athens easier. He met us at the metro and walked us to his home, provided us with invaluable information that got us around the city. He sat with us as often as we wanted or needed to orient and help us with our plans.  Christos went as far as to offer to share his meal! The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The location was literally minutes from the Acropolis, as well as the downtown markets and pedestrian shopping, all by foot. We cannot praise Christos enough for his kind and gracious nature.
"
1824675,26252082,2015-02-08,1679551,Fabian,"Christos was an amazing host - kind and welcome from the very first moment on.  The home was exactly as described, clean and comfortable. It is also just a 10 min walk from the main tourist attractions of Athens and also just a few minutes away from the subway to the airport.
I would recommend Christos place anytime to any traveler to Athens"
1824675,26522731,2015-02-15,14181300,Valentin,"Christos is an amazing host. He will help you with everything. The flat is as described, very clean and in a very nice neighbourhood. "
1824675,26926874,2015-02-22,127098,Sarah,"Christos was very helpful for myself and my son. He made us feel very welcome. Even in winter, the terrace is a pure delight to enjoy morning breakfast. The room is spatious and the bed is extremely comfortable. The price is a real bargain for the location, in walking distance of the train stop to the airport (keiramekos) or near the acropolis. If you understand  french, ask for the guide Angelina at the National archeological museum. She is a sweet old lady and a wonderful story teller."
1824675,27256887,2015-03-01,22017983,Astrid,"We loved to be in the house of Christos. He's a very kind and social person, wo make you feel at home. He picked us from the metro station and drived us at the end of the week back to the airport early in the morning.
The room was big and clean and had a nice bed, the roofgarden is fabulous! The atmosphere was very agreable and friendly.
He also cooked very good greece food.
He is the one you want to have as your guest in your house!"
1824675,27409607,2015-03-03,23049434,Daqian,"We loved the very short stay here, beds were comfy and the sun fills the room in the morning. Christos is very kind and helpful, wish we could stay longer!"
1824675,27498261,2015-03-06,5841693,"Peter, Lesley (Megan)       ","Christos came to the Metro station to collect me, which was very helpful. Ambling back to his spacious apartment we had time for little chats. Everything was clean and I could use the kitchen if I wanted to (but only made cups of tea). I found the location good because I like walking, and that's what I did up and down the hill heading for the Monastiraki area to where everything is happening. "
1824675,27600634,2015-03-08,21971855,Oktay,"""Your room in the perfect area"" is lovely place and very close to city center. It was like my friend's home; warm and clean. The bed was comfortable. The price is economic for the location, in walking distance of the train stop to the airport (Keiramekos) or near the Acropolis.

The host Christos is very friendly. He's a very kind and social person who made us feel at home. He gave us a map and explained everything we needed to know for the next day. He introduced his wonderful friends. We had a good time with them.

Thank you Christos... Thank you for all. I hope we will come again and spend more time with you and your friends..."
1824675,27835604,2015-03-13,1696988,Krystyn,"Christos was very helpful in showing us to his place. He met us at an easy meeting point and showed us all the best places to go in Athens. His flat is very close to the Acropolis and is close to useful subway stations. The bedroom and living room are very spacious and just what we expected. While the shower is a little old fashioned and takes planning in advance (you have to turn the hot water on 20 minutes before your shower), our overall experience was a good one. Thanks!"
1824675,28123208,2015-03-18,7176436,Joshua,"The host, Christos, was great! He was waiting at the apartment and let us in. He gave us handy information, such as the wifi password, how to use the bathroom and laundry machine, as well as information about the neighborhood such as the closest grocery store. He then pulled out a map and we talked through how to get to the major sites, where the metro stops were, and some restaurants that he suggested.  It was quite helpful and we actually did go to one, Falafella's, which was amazing. The room itself is quite large, the wifi was fast, and he allowed access to the refrigerator. He was a great host and I would stay with him again. I felt that the listing was accurate . "
1824675,28267525,2015-03-21,26112360,Christina,"Christos' place was perfect for my three-day stay in Athens. It was in a residential area with cafes and bars scattered throughout, which was nice to get away from all the touristy areas.  The main attractions are within a 10-20 min walk, and navigation from the airport was very easy.  Christos was a wonderful host, offering to meet me at the metro station and updating me on a strike prior to my arrival that affected the metro schedule. He also provided me a map and gave me recommendations for authentic Greek restaurants and bars. The rooftop was one of my favorite areas because it was a beautiful place to relax after a long day of sightseeing.  I definitely recommend staying with Christos!"
1824675,28353143,2015-03-22,17321138,Megan,"Christos was an excellent and very generous host for our stay in Athens. His shared house is extremely unique and the balcony his a perfect spot to drink a coffee and have breakfast. The location is perfect for walking to the Acropolis or the Sunday Flea Market and has some great restaurants and cafes just a short distance down the street.

Our host greeted us then provided a map and some great information about where to go. The room we stayed in was next door to Christos' room, but we barely noticed that he was there. He provided everything we needed such as towels and a clean bed. The room was a little bit cold and faces a very busy street, so at night we could hear lots of cars right outside the window. There were a few minor issues that weren't what I expected, such as the door to the bedroom is very loud, no shower curtain in the bathroom and the house being a little bit cold. Other than that Christos was an extremely gracious host and location was ideal.  We walked ~15 min to the train station the next morning to catch the subway to the airport (14 Euro for 2 tickets)."
1824675,29034857,2015-04-03,7261404,Saskia,"Ich hatte mir vorher die vielen, sehr positiven Kommentare von Christos' Unterkunft durchgelesen und war selbst auch zufrieden. Das Abholen von der Metro hat gut geklappt, das Zimmer und die Gemeinschaftsräume (Küche, Bad, Flur, Terrasse) waren sauber und einladend gemütlich. Man hat gemerkt, dass sich Christos wirklich beim Einrichten des Gästezimmers und der Wohnung, aber auch als Gastgeber selbst Mühe gibt. Da ich mit meinem Freund fast zwei Wochen bei Christos war, haben wir auch mitbekommen, dass er das Bad regelmäßig putzt und die Küche immer für uns nutzbar hinterließ. Einige Lebensmittel durften wir mitbenutzen oder wurden dazu eingeladen etwas mitzuessen. Er war sogar etwas böse, als er sah, dass wir Beuteltee gekauft haben, obwohl er noch so viel losen Tee von dieser Sorte hatte, den wir ruhig mittrinken durften.
Am Ankunftstag gab uns Christos eine kurze Orientierung und ein paar Tipps zu Athen, weil wir zum ersten Mal da waren und auch einige Fragen hatten. Auch wenn wir sonst irgendein Anliegen hatten, von denen es jedoch insgesamt wenige waren, war er immer hilfsbereit. Ansonsten ließ er uns völlig unser Ding machen und zog sich eher zurück, als dass er für uns immer präsent war."
1824675,29596387,2015-04-10,13867339,Sandra Patricia,"Christos es un increible anfitrion. Nos ayudo a llevar las valijas por la calle hasta llegar a su casa y nos guardo el equipaje por cuatro dias mientras fuimos a las islas (ya estaba acordado). El dia que volvimos cocino para todos (riquisimo!!) Debido a que llegamos tarde. La casa es muy comoda. Tiene habitacion y living privado y el baño tambien es privado solo para huespedes.  Es muy recomendable tanto por la casa en si, como por su anfitrion."
1824675,29905998,2015-04-14,22273790,David,"Christos was very welcoming and provides lovely accommodation close to all transport connections.

Property close to all attractions of Athens in a safe area."
1824675,30084154,2015-04-17,29018749,Lieve,"Kristos picked us up at the metro although his apartment is not so far and easy to find. We felt very welcome from the start. The two rooms were  very clean and nice.   Kristos gave us very useful information about the city, restaurants etc.  he also gave us a map.  His apartment is very  good located to visit Athens, just a few minutes’ walk and you are already in the Acropolis area.
Our children felt very comfortable and liked the rooftop very much.  Kristos is a good host,  he was there when we needed him, but was also very discrete.  We absolutely recommend Kristos and his apartment!
"
1824675,30400691,2015-04-21,28873991,Meri,"Christos was very nice, he picked us up from the airport and drove us to his house, where he gave us a map and showed us where the nearest places to see were. The room was very comfortable, clean and walking distance from pretty much everything we wanted to see. Absolutely recommend staying at Christos' house, even though we were there for only two days! "
1824675,30464556,2015-04-22,27841733,Brock,"Listing was very accurate and the apartment was very much as shwon in the pictures - wonderful details in the house - I felt like I was getting a very true picture of an Athenian house of this time period and location.
Christos was a wonderful host who went way beyond the call of duty without even being asked.  He accompanied us to two different subway stops and was kind enough to share music from his collection with me!  -- a kind and artistic soul with a great ""green thumb"" and skill at growing plants.  His apartment has many wonderful decorating touches and the location is extremely convenient to both the temples of the Acropolis and Filoppapou  Hill and to the main subway lines.
I would love to return and stay with Christos for a longer stay with more time to explore Athens and hear Rembetika!
Thank you, Christos! "
1824675,30796849,2015-04-27,5659019,Sasha,"Christos was wonderful! His place is well located, and the room is massive. walkable distance from acropolis. Super safe area. I defiantly recommend this place! "
1824675,31027679,2015-05-01,22161351,Joris,"We, my son and I, had a very pleasant stay at Christos place. The location is perfect, close to the centre yet out of the mainstream tourist area. Good local bars and restaurants. The apartment is spacious and light with a nice and personal interior design. The roof terrace is great! Christos keeps his place very clean and gives us a lot of privacy. All together I certainly recommend this place to other travellers."
1824675,31165318,2015-05-03,26405218,Patrick,"Plusieurs éléments nous ont fait sentir que nous étions les bienvenus.
Christos nous a accueilli sur le pas de sa porte à 23h, nous a aidé à monter les bagages et ensuite nous a fait découvrir le quartier et malgré l'heure tardive, nous a accompagné dans un restaurant plein de charme qu'il nous a choisi.
Le logement a bien été décrit, nous réservant de belles surprises.
Le quartier tranquille nous a beaucoup plu et nous avons trouvé quelques rues plus loin des restaurants typiques aux menus savoureux et à des prix très raisonnables."
1824675,31507569,2015-05-06,26546317,Floris,"We visited Athens for three days with a family of two adults and two children.
We were welcomed by Christos at the metro station and he took us to his house. We had two rooms and could use the kitchen. But the best place was the roof terrace, with all the beautifull plants Christos is keeping there.

The house is in a neighbourhood wich is not touristic, but quite near all the places you would like to visit. Acropolis can easily be reached by foot.

Christos is a very friendly man and made us feel welcome. He gives advise, but also gives you your own space.

This was our first aribnb, butafter this very pleasant experience, we will defently do it again.

Thank you Christos.

Petra, Floris, Merel, Nienke."
1824675,31783121,2015-05-10,5277653,Celine,"Highly recommended.
The neighbourhood where the apartment is located has a real alternative and laid back charm to it. Friendly people, chilled bars, authentic restaurants with delicious native food.
Actually you can say that about a lot of Athens. Totally exceeded all expectations. Incredible city. A real mix of history and cosmopolitan city life.
So much to see and do we didn't spend a great deal of time in the apartment but it suited us perfectly. Large room. Clean and tidy. And Christos is a great host. He's available when you need him but gives you all the privacy you need/want.
We would certainly return and would recommend the neighbourhood, Christos apartment and the city to friends and family."
1824675,31933433,2015-05-12,290387,Bob,"Cristos was wonderful, the perfect airbnb host!. He watched for our taxi and came out to help us with our bags when wee arrived. As others have said, he was friendly and available but never interfered with our privacy. Our stay in Athens was very brief but it was great to walk from Cristos' place to the Acropolis! The roof garden is really charming; an oasis on a hot day."
1824675,32444551,2015-05-18,8368154,Hansjörg,"Christos hat mich freundlich und hilfsbereit empfangen. Das Zimmer ist gross und die Dachterrasse wunderbar. Das Haus ist mit der U-Bahn gut erreichbar (ca. 10 min zu Fuss). Das Quartier ist eigentlich ruhig, nur am Wochenende hört man in der Nacht Autos und Motorräder vorbeirasen."
1824675,32749360,2015-05-21,18205765,Robert,"Christos met us on his bike and was so warm and welcoming.  His house is a bit tricky to find, but our GPS helped.  Such an oasis in an excellent location!  We loved the rooftop garden.  The character of the neighbourhood is so pleasant and walking distance to all of the major attractions.  Christos cooked us an excellent Greek meal and showed us around."
1824675,33440105,2015-05-28,7006818,Karen,"Christos' place is exactly as described.  The bedroom is large with a comfortable bed, and the attached sitting room is quite spacious.  There are two large windows and a small balcony.  Everything was very clean.  Christos is a warm and welcoming host, we were two females and felt safe and secure.  The shared kitchen and bathroom are perfectly easy to navigate with no awkwardness.  The roof top garden is the gem of the place, we simply loved it.  I would stay with  Christos again without hesitation. "
1824675,33764055,2015-06-01,24978516,Katherine,"Christos was a great host! He was very welcoming and provided us with a map and great information. The room was spacious, and we had everything we needed for a wonderful weekend in Athens. The rooftop was also amazing. Thanks Christos! "

Il nous a expliqué le quartier qui est proche de l'Acropole.
Nous recommandons vivement cet hôte aux autres voyageurs."
1824675,34425224,2015-06-08,29378332,Meg,"The room itself was absolutely great (clean, comfortable and roomy) and as it was a very hot night we really appreciated the fan. The rest of the home was a little grimy for my family's liking. I did not pay attention to the fact that our room did not have a bathroom and so our bathroom was shared with the host. That made my husband crazy. I'm not as picky as my boys are though so I was fine with it and thought our host was helpful and low key. He walked a considerable distance to help us when we got ourselves lost coming from the train station. He let us keep our bags in his living room while the room was getting prepared. My only complaint was that we weren't able to get in to our room until after 5pm and we were super tired from an early flight and would have loved a short nap before heading out to explore Athens. "
1824675,34736458,2015-06-11,16969435,Greg,Very nice place. Beautiful rooftop garden. Christos is a great guy with lots of tips for things to do in Athens!
1824675,34977230,2015-06-14,28185131,Andrew,"Christos is a really awesome dude and host, made us feel at home, told us cool things and just a super nice guy.
His place is amazing! The roof top is incredible and the rooms are really big. Perfect location too.
Only negative is that the road it pretty noisey but just take some ear plugs - the noise is definitely worth it for the place."
1824675,35839194,2015-06-22,31661090,Joan,"Al arribar, el Christos va ser molt atent amb nosaltres, situant-nos al barri, recomanant llocs per anar a menjar, per on sortir, on anar a passejar i a quines hores... en fi, es coneix perfectament la zona i els seus consells són més que fiables. El barri està molt i molt bé: ideal per sortir a menjar a preus molt raonables i a un agradable passeig a peu del centre.
En definitiva, un lloc perfecte per quedar-se a dormir un parell de dies si sou quatre persones ben avingudes, ja que les dues habitacions són contínues.

1824675,36056884,2015-06-24,35879309,Kori,"We had a really great time staying at this apartment in Athens. It is in the most perfect location, close to the ruins, great shopping, and really great local restaurants. You can completely avoid the crowded downtown area of Athens by staying at this apartment. The apartment itself was very nice and clean with an amazing roof top deck. I would definitely recommend this apartment. "

Accueil parfait malgré un fort retard, et conseils très avisés en français."

360940,6498710,2013-08-14,32329,Gokhan,"The.flat is design at its best. The vintage furniture Dimitrios collected is in excellent shape and adds a very elegant touch to the flat. We were very comfortable and we felt most welcome. If you would be into staying in a vintage building with a vintage setting (high ceilings, old school veranda/elevator etc), this one's for you. Some frills of a contemporary flat are not there, but I think the design of this flat is definitely worth it. It's very authentic and very well thought of. Dimitrios is an excellent host and has been extremely kind - we were greeted with wine/full fridge/his mom's homemade jams, etc. And he is very responsive gave us loads of tips about the city and he even called some restaurants for us. All in all we were very pleased with our stay. "
360940,11923396,2014-04-19,1403819,Dimitris,"Dimitris is a great host and a fantastic guy in general. He was very attentive to making our stay enjoyable and very comfortable. Fresh cookies and a cake were waiting for us at checkin and he showed the place with patience.

The house itself is big with good views and was very clean on our arrival. Great for art lovers.

The Flat prefers takes a conscious stand on the design and adventurous side rather than the super comfortable one. And that's one of its beauties."
360940,13020688,2014-05-17,2692714,Marica,"I cannot begin to explain how pleased we were with the Flat. It is everything that we have ever dreamed of in a bnb and more. Demitrios and Eva are the most gracious host. The flat had the best vibe. Demitrios was so accommodating that he allowed us to leave our luggage while we went to other destinations between stays at the Flat. The only drawback was that the flat was not close to any metro station but everything else about it, most especially the flat mates more than made up for the location. We had our last meal on Athens with Dimitriois and Eva and became fast friends. It also has the best coffee. Will definitely recommend this. "
360940,13435139,2014-05-27,12609409,Asia,"The flat was exactly how it is pictured. We absolutely loved the decor. Dimitrios was so friendly and extremely helpful. When we first arrived he spent a good amount of time explaining and suggesting things to do in Athens and answered our many questions. He also sent us a detailed email with suggested places to eat, things to see, radio stations and lots of other little tips. We were also welcomed with a bottle of wine and brownies!! Which was a plus for us lol

The neighborhood was nice and we often saw families and children playing outside. A couple of cab drivers mentioned that it wasn’t "" the best area"" but honestly we enjoyed the local feeling we experienced and didn’t perceive it to be a unsafe area. We took cabs everywhere we went because it was cheaper for us (being a group of 4) and getting a cab was really easy just up the block.
"
360940,14041574,2014-06-10,6435897,Kasturi,"It's an amazing artistic and lovely apartment. While we managed to stay for only one night at this apartment, on our way out, the visit to Greece was definitely richer by this one night's experience.
The locality is cosy and residential, and just off the main road. The Acropolis area is just a short cab ride away.
The host Dimitrios is very friendly and likes to support his guests by sharing little notes that make Athens seem like home.
Would definitely repeat :)"

thanks for all!
hopefully we will be back soon!

360940,15078425,2014-07-01,6201207,Daniel,"We stayed 2 days at The Flat.
It was a great experience. The place is in a safe área and you can go to the center (Monasteraki) in less than 5 minutes by taxi and it will cost around 5 euros.

The Flat has two rooms with big windows and doors. There is no air conditiong in the rooms but the host provided us fans (just in case), but the rooms are vvery fresh - even with the warm weather of Athens.

The host was waiting us on time (actually we ser late because of the boat from Mykonos) and he did everything to make a great experience been there.

If you prefer to stay in a place quiet, calm and away from the center, this is a nice opportunity. "
360940,15290058,2014-07-06,14053450,Rodrigo,Lovely apartment... seems you are in a movie... It was a great experience :)
360940,20126587,2014-09-23,3138284,Stephanie,"""The Flat"" was my 5th experience with AirBnB. We booked Dimitrios's apartment based on the amenities it advertised / we required - WIFI, an equipped kitchen for simple cooking and a nice patio - a good home base from where we could comfortably continue planning our vacation in Greece. When we arrived on a Friday, Dimitrios was out of town but his friend Eva was there to welcome us, she was very nice and friendly. After she showed us the place we tested the wifi and the connection was very poor. She contacted Dimitrios to solve the issue. We later heard back from Dimitrios saying that he called the internet company but they couldn't do anything until Monday (the day we were to leave). His flat doesn't have its own router - the wifi signal comes from the neighbor and is sent via a wifi repeater, which was barely able to connect to the internet - Eva tried to reset it next door but it never worked except an occasional slow 2 minutes before dropping the connection. We got full 5 bars of reception - but NO actual connection to the net. The solution - IF we sat right beside the front door or in the hallway, it could work for a little longer. It was good enough to order a cab from a smartphone app, but the connection was not fast or solid enough to access the web for any length of time needed to plan anything - not even find a hotel! We literally wasted 2 days sitting by the front door trying to plan our activities. The furniture was laid out differently than on his website. Dining room and living room were switched around. Sofa was put on a plywood / wooden pallet 'stage' - Not very user friendly. The kitchen description speaks of a mini oven. There was no mini oven, just a microwave and a panini maker! Glasses in the cupboard full of spots, generally the cleanliness was not what I had previously experienced through AirBnB. No knives to cut bread, fruit or veggies. Used, open bottles of pop, wine, mayo and jam left in the fridge (leftover from previous renters I assume.) The patio was great although watch out for the awning bars, they are very low and hurts the forehead, a ribbon or something to catch your eye would be helpful to avoid hitting your head - the sun is bright and makes it hard to see. BUT, The very first sign of trouble was when using the bathroom for the first time... There was a big 'skid mark' already in the toilet (and black stains / mold behind the toilet). This was seen right after Eva told us the place had just been cleaned by the woman next door before we arrived. My spouse woke up the next morning with multiple bug bites on his body. Be careful of the exposed hot water pipe on the wall when in the shower, its..."
360940,20536066,2014-09-30,19637799,Andreas,Dimitrios organised my booking at short notice and got the flat together in perfect order for my visit. He was happy to give me information about the area and stocked the house with some food and drink which really helped. The flat is very spacious and comfortable and everything worked great. The area is also decent and many hours were spent on the balcony enjoying the view and peace and quiet. A great flat for the price in a really decent location and a host who was happy to help with anything I needed. Would recommend to others.
360940,29470584,2015-04-07,5369202,Daniel,"We had a great time during our long weekend at Dimitrios' place. The Flat is amazing, and is very well located. Dimitrios' was very kind when receiving us, and accommodating to our needs. He even left us a welcoming basket and constantly checked if we needed anything. I would definitely  recommend to stay at Dimitrios'"
360940,32711725,2015-05-20,2231963,Natali,"Dimitris is an excellent host. Very friendly!!!
He waited for us at the apartment and welcomed us with wine and muffins. He made us feel at home.
He took time for us, showed us around and gave us tips where to go for drinks and good food. He even send us a mail with great places, which we visited.
The apartment is fabulous and very clean. In real its bigger than it is on the pictures and with every day you spend there you realize more details, funny stuff and vintage things in there. The balcony is huge. We spend a lot of hours there drinking wine.
The neighbourhood is good and there is a park right in front of the house. It's just a five minute ride with the taxi to syntagma square.
We loved Athens and we really enjoyed this apartment.
Dimitri was also there when we left and called us a taxi to the airport.
Thank you so much. We had a great time and we will come back."
360940,33181119,2015-05-25,15252738,Gwenn,"Dimitrios was absolutely lovely and a really great host. My friend and I had an excellent 2-night stay at the flat and everything went very smoothly. The flat is very cool and true to the pictures and there are lots of welcoming little touches. Location is good (although we found that a lot of taxis had difficulty finding the street). Dimitrios gave us a good list of tips for places to eat and visit, etc., which we appreciated. I would highly recommend a stay at the flat!"
360940,34091920,2015-06-04,12284514,Isaac,"You could not ask for a better host! Dimitris went out of his way to make us feel welcome and provided us with so many helpful suggestions of sights to see, places to eat etc. He knew we were vegan so made sure there was fruit and nuts for us to snack on, on arrival. The apartment was clean and tidy and everything worked fine. We really liked the neighbourhood and had home-cooked meals out on the balcony most evenings, so felt very at home. Location is great- close to the city centre but far enough out if you want a bit of quiet time.
Loved the ethos of the flat as a non-profit arts space. Would definitely stay here again! "

The balcony is awesome to sit and chill. Taxis were super easy to get from the main road (even when we left for our flight at 4am).
110085,287066,2011-05-29,323091,Darren,"Terrible experience. Owner is extremely unfriendly and hostile. accused us of being drug abusers when he saw body powder on the bed, repeatedly used vulgarities, called us abnormal, said we messed up his place when it was not at all messy, threatened to call the police, threatened to kick us out ,warned us not to give him a bad review, blamed us for the wet floor in his kitchen when his washing machine malfunctioned, made us pay 20euros to open the door to his house(we accidentally left the keys locked in), made us pay for his phone bills(overcharging us), atrocious attidue and terrible serivce.

Ruined my entire greek (website hidden) NOT USE ROOMS FROM THIS GUY.

it was also terrible location.

he continues to claim that merely accidentally leaving the keybehind(by pure accident and yes, folly) was ""extremely irresponsible"" and therefore deserving of the numerous vulgarities and threats he used against us. we even have pictures of theapparent ""messy state"" the place was in (which of course is not even messy).

tells me he wants to take this up with  my country's consulate nw.

future users, you decide. is leaving a key in the room by accident (the door autolocks) deserving of such atrocious treatment. it really is  your choice.cheers, only wanting to help here"
110085,342420,2011-06-29,592143,Hunter,"Great experience with Menelaos.  He was very thorough and made impeccable arrangements to meet  in spite of our airline delays.  The apartment is in a wonderful neighborhood with real Athenians.  We met some of the kindest people in the shops there.  Although the place is not right on the main drag, it was very easy to grab taxis at any time of day or night.

The place was extremely clean and very functional.  We had some issues with getting all the air conditioners to work all the time, but it could be my inability to operate European-style units.  Regardless, the apartment was very comfortable with plenty of room for my family of four."

Elastyczny czas opuszczenia mieszkania . Dziękuję i pozdrawiam
110066,344689,2011-06-30,417821,Catherine,"Excellent experience with Menelaos. We didn´t stay in this apartment but another one just a couple of streets away on the top floor. He met us at the apartment and showed us around and helped us with suggestions on where to go in Athens, very helpful. He was also able to let us stay an extra 2 nights when our tour was cancelled and we stayed in Athens longer than planned. Apartment is fantastic and great value for money. Everything works perfectly, couldn´t ask for more. Lots of shops close by and an easy walk to all the sights. Will definitely stay here again next time."
110066,399167,2011-07-26,821932,Joanne,"The taxis were on strike when we arrived in Athens and Michael very helpfullly directed us to Sygmata square and then picked us up.  The accomadation was not what we had booked but was still central and besides lacking cutlery was comfortable. A washing machine to wash our clothes, fantastic just mind you follow the instructions and close the flaps as this may cause the lid to lock and clothes retrieval is impossible.  Michael helped us over this problem too, even finishing the wash and then hanging them out to dry. We highly recommend Michael for future trips to Athens"

The location is great. A typical greek neighborhood. You will find everything you may need there. And with prices incredible lows.
To go to Athens atractions you can walk or use the many bus options. There is a bus stop very near the house, no more than 50 meters. And the public transporte in Athens is very cheap.

The apartment is exactly like the photos show. And we love the bed. We had great sleep nights.

We sure recommended this place to anyone going to Athens. "

Il est situé dans un quartier où vous trouvez encore les petits commerçants, c'est très sympathique; tout est à portée de main ainsi que les transports en commun.
Si vous aimez comme moi la marche,vous serez gâtés mais les rues montent et descendent continuellement : assez fatigant. Des parcs à 500m.Pas bruyant malgré la proximité de 2 rues fréquentées. Bémol : si vous avez une voiture , grande difficulté pour se garer.
Le centre est à 20 min à pieds.
Alex est un hôte sympathique et tellement serviable.Toujours prêt à vous rendre service avec le sourire et rapidement. Et dieu sait combien je l'ai sollicité ! Merci Alex

The flat is indeed in easy walking distance from the center (all downhill)  and if tired after a busy day, trolly #4 gets you almost directly to the front door.
Great value for a very reasonable price. I can only recommend booking adn hope you enjoy your stay in Athens as I did."

The area is quiet and peaceful, but at the same time the location is very convenient - the bus stop is just a few steps away, There are many stores around and you can by there fruits, fish, swееts, freshly baked bread...The apartment's kitchen is realy fully equiped so you only can enjoy on your stay here! I highly recomпend it!!!"

We picked it for it's nice large space and very affordable price. We were willing to over look the unmaintained and dated kitchen because we planned to eat out for the eight days we were there. We realized from the pictures that the bathroom was in a similar state but we were willing to take a chance. We never anticipated that the bedding would smell of someone else's sweat and the towels smell sour. We bought four new pillows and left them there so that should be better. Need to make sure the bedding and towels are laundered to proper standards. Would be nice to have a floor heater.
We liked the space and location and the way it was equipped, this could be a great value."

Fresh seafood , markets, farmacy, nice cafes and bars very close by, on the neighbor street ,what else you need for a happy life))) We were travelling with our 1 year daughter, she was very happy to play in a patio, so this is a good place to stay even with a  babies.

Apartment is very well equipped, you can find everything you need there, including a hairdryer and an iron. It's a real living space, not a faceless hotel room.

Alex is a very friendly host, he answered to all our touristic questions and even helped with printing our tickets. Thanks a lot!

Price / quality ratio = perfect.

"
932359,13505578,2014-05-29,591284,Natalie,"We had a great stay in Alex's apartment - 14 nights total from the middle to the end of May.  The big bedroom and living room had plenty of space for us to relax.  It was very nice to have a kitchen and washing machine for travelling comfort.  The apartment is located in a convenient area with access to groceries, restaurants, and all other daily needs.  Very quiet at night.  We walked all over town from the apartment - hardly even used the metro because everything is easy to reach on foot (if you like walking).  The bedrooms both have access to a courtyard and fresh air, while the living room also has a big window.  The bed was comfortable.  Nice to have free WiFi.

The only down-sides, which are minimal in relation to the extremely low price of the apartment, are the dated kitchen and bathroom.  The bathroom has all brown accessories (toilet, tub, sink, non-working bidet), a ceiling that is 3' lower than other rooms, no window, and a leak at the back of the toilet that looks like it has been patched numerous times.  None of this may bother you, it just depends how easily you are skeezed out.  The kitchen is also dated with no window, but we just did our cooking and then ate in the living room.  Either way, seeing that the price is SO affordable, the place was great.

I definitely recommend staying here if you are on a budget and just need somewhere convenient to sleep while exploring Athens.  No regrets with this choice - $400 for two weeks of accommodations!  Can't be beat."

932359,14501572,2014-06-21,6539788,Marcin,"Flat of Alexandros has 3 big room. All are comfortable and well equipped.

The Kitchen and bathroom could be refreshed.

From metro line is 20 minutes walk, but to Temple of Zeus is just 25 minutes by foot so we gave up using metro.

But for this price - this place is worth visiting."
932359,15549003,2014-07-11,16946013,Samiyah,"I stayed at this apartment with my parents and brother in July for 8 nights. The pictures accurately shows what to expect. It's a great apartment for anyone that is travelling to Athens on a budget. The apartment is located in a convenient neighbourhood with lots of charm. You can find everything you need nearby. Although the kitchen and bathroom are outdated - you can't go wrong with the reasonable price.

Although we never met Alexandro, he was a good host and responded to messages promptly. He also left city maps in the apartment, which was super convenient.

I would recommend this apartment for anyone that is looking for a good deal in Athens!"
932359,18649504,2014-08-30,14849718,Иннокентий,"Алекс отличный хост! Вежливый и отзывчивый.
Квартира, в целом, соответствует фотографиям. Из минусов можно выделить, пожалуй, только отсутствие занавески в ванной и отсутствие окна в кухне. В остальном, все понравилось.
Дом удачно расположен, на соседней улице есть все необходимые магазины, остановка общественного транспорта в сторону центра в трех минутах хотьбы. "
932359,20790437,2014-10-05,18696447,Christina,"Alexandros was very helpful and the apartment was lovely, much bigger than I imagined. It is lovely and quiet and a perfect place for exploring the city of Athens.  With shops very close by, great fishmongers, grocery and some amazing bakeries. We used it as a base for a week as a journalist and graphic designer working on projects in Greece.  Would definitely stay here again."
932359,30459269,2015-04-22,6481042,Sandy,i stayed a week in Alex's home and it's very big. Kitchen has everything if u need to cook. Excellent WiFi connectio  & Supermarket. Bakery and an excellent gyro shop are all around the corner! Recommend if you're a famil. Since it's huge!
932359,31772570,2015-05-10,26043844,Estitxu And Tomàs,"Alexandros fue un buen anfitrión, muy amable y acogedor, y estuvo disponible cuando lo necesitamos.
La casa es muy grande y cómoda, tiene un salón muy amplio con luz natural. La cama de la habitación de matrimonio también es grande, dispone de varios juegos de sábanas limpios y toallas a disposición del huésped.
La cocina dispone de todos los utensilios básicos para cocinar.
El barrio es muy tranquilo, con un supermercado a dos minutos caminando, una cafetería, restaurantes y tiendas.
¡Nuestra experiencia en casa de Alexandros ha sido perfecta!"
932359,32805192,2015-05-22,23350936,Alexandra,"The flat is ok and comfortable, perfect location and good price, we walked everywhere. We didn't meet Alexandros but he called us when we needed it, We would recommend it and go back if possible. :)"
932359,33587219,2015-05-30,18541898,Martin,"The appartment has a lots of space and we appreciated the pricing. We liked the surrounding area as there are a lot of shops (bakery, mini market, deli) and a bus station just around the corner. "

Расположение отличное: рядом стадион, парк, остановка 209 автобуса, трамвай и метро в 15-20 минутах ходьбы, хороший дешевый супермаркет. Все достопримечательности рядом; дорога до пляжа (Коломаки) занимает 40 минут (5 трамвай; или 550 автобус, а потом 3 трамвай). Соотношение цена/качество оптимальное! Большое спасибо Алексу и его маме!
We stayed here during 10 days. Excellent three-room apartments. There is absolutely everything you need for a comfortable life. Location is excellent: close to the stadium, park, 209 bus stop, tram and metro in 15-20 minutes walk, good cheap supermarket. All attractions are near; the road to the beach (Kolomaki) takes about 40 minutes (tram 5; or bus 550 and then tram 3). Price/quality ratio is optimal. Very good! Thanks to Alex and to his mom!

932359,35983673,2015-06-23,18127560,Emil,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
155271,352969,2011-07-04,762635,Marta,"The apartment is new and comfortable, spacious and sunny. All the dishes and furniture in the kitchen and bathroom are new and functional. The neighborhood is quiet and residential; the building is surrounded by embassies and private clinics, an excellent neighborhood. The owner left a number of suggestions in a folder on the table and we listen many, such as eating out at interesting places. Because of this home it was a very pleasant stay in Athens.

"
155271,422170,2011-08-05,281323,Simon,"Lovely renovated apartment in great area with excellent transport links. Roula made me feel very comfortable and welcome and met me at the apartment even though I arrived late.

In the apartment she has thought of everything from espresso machines to ironing boards to restaurant recommendations. She kept in touch making sure all was well and indeed I immediately felt like I was part of her extended family.

I'm already looking forward to me next stay."
155271,424244,2011-08-06,717975,Anna,"This B&B is, in reality, a full apartment for guests. An apartment where is present the love of owner ( and her family) for the little things.
I suggest to reserve because is very confortable and well connected.
"
155271,435771,2011-08-10,75814,Numberone,"Highly recommended !!! Book it while you can.

I must extend my personal thanks to Roula. She is such a wonderful  person and kindest host. It was such a great pleasure to get to meet a warm/kind local host like her. This is something very personal that you could never get out of hotels.
I cannot thank her enough of how helpful she is for a traveler from far east like myself, who knows nothing about Athen/Aegean cultures.

Everything is real as it appears on the photo and functional. There are several antiques and art pieces that you can tell the good taste of the owner. Little balcony outside facing the apartment's cour yard is great at both day time/night time.

Location is very SAFE (this is very important in Athens) and convenient.
Easy access to/from airport to city center with buses / metro. The neighborhood has US embassy and a few others, so you should not worry walking around even at night time.

My first visit to Athen has become such a lovely / memorable trip thanks to Raula. I hope I will get a second chance to visit the city and again and my first choice would be the same place."
155271,463536,2011-08-21,736847,Todor,"The flat resides in the top three or two locations in Athens. Just tens of meters away from it you'll find the first embassies, and little bit further away the Athens Concert Hall. It is a very safe and quiet area. The inner core of Athens, the Acropolis and the quarts in the vicinity are just two metro stations away.

As others have mentioned, Roula made sure you get to know all the best secrets of Athens. Take some time and read through the notebook containing the suggestions.

The flat itself has offers all the comforts one needs and no hotel can beat the atmosphere.  It has a wonderful balcony overlooking the beautiful old trees in the inner courtyard while in the same time giving you the overview of the entire sky. At least one dinner there is something I wholeheartedly recommend. Actually this kind of flat is the reason why you signed up with the Airbnb in the first place.

The hosts are warm and extremely helpful people. We had a couple of typical tourist dramas which all ended well mostly thanks to Roula and here adorable daughter and niece.

From the depth of my heart I recommend you to choose this appartment. I cannot imagine anything better for your stay in Athens."
155271,474634,2011-08-25,306675,Anne,"The apartment is really beautiful and Roula and her daughter Ellie, very helpfull.  I arrived in the middle of the night because of a change in a flight and they manage to welcome us (my two children and me).  The appartment is in a quiet and central area, very easy.  We stayed only two nights (it was the end of our trip in Greece) but next time in Athens, I certainly will come back in Roula's place.
Thanks a lot!"
155271,482764,2011-08-28,381198,E,"Nice Property, good host and a great stay!"
155271,498500,2011-09-03,739032,Pedro,"There is not good qualification enough (in starts) to point Roula's hospitality and her attention to us. Her place is a lovely ""space"" quite center in Athens where you will feel like home. Lovely furniture, incredibly confortable matress and very cool and fresh living-room/balcony. It's a relaxing place in the middle of these crazy and noisy city.

Although this valoration is to qualificate how is her appartment, I couldn't miss to say how lovely and nice she was with us, even arriving so late and able always to recommend us grate places to go. Roula, you're simply fantastic; keep smiling and travelling. "
155271,502366,2011-09-05,877387,Ravi,"Roula was really considerate to give us all info for her apt and the surroundings, even though i just stayed there for a day, would like to recommend it to everyone, specially for young and mature couples, the apartment was well equipped and cozy. Cheers"
155271,516121,2011-09-09,972823,Pascal,"After finally finding Roula´s apartment through the maze of greek one-way streets we were delighted to be greeted so friendly by Roula in her beautiful apartment. Everything really looks like on the pictures, it is clean, safe and furnished with much love for the detail. Another  great plus you will appreciate after a long day in noisy Athens is that Roula´s apartment is a really quiet place where you can relax wonderfully.
Before heading out into the city we were given some good advice on where to eat and how to access public transport in the area. Especially Roula´s recommendation of the bakery ""Mr. Baker""  was excellent. The main sites in the center of Athens (Akropolis, Plaka) are very close- only two metro-stations away.
We were very comfortable in the apartment and enjoyed every moment there, sadly our stay was only for one day. When we come back to spend some time in Athens we will definately stay at Roula´s place. Roula was truely an excellent host, we absoultely recommend her apartment for a stay in Athens- better than any hotel."
155271,519308,2011-09-10,987527,Jenny,"We had a wonderful stay in Roulas apartment and Roula was so accommodating.  The public transport was close by and Roula provided lots of information before we arrived.

On our return from Santorini Roula ensured someone was at the apartment to let us in and it was almost midnight.  I cant think of many hosts that would be so caring.

Thank you so much Roula, we will recommend your place to our family, friends and work colleagues."
155271,522096,2011-09-11,1111708,Laura,Roula was a 10* host with a 10* apartment to match!! She helped us with information from how to get to the apartment to what to see and where to eat and shop!! Couldn't have asked for a more helpful host! The apartment is amazing! Had a wonderful stay - wish it could have been for longer! Thanks Roula!
155271,531591,2011-09-14,915345,Elizabeth,"We had a wonderful stay in Athens in the apartment.  Roula met us when we arrived, swiftly settled us in and gave us some good advice on where to eat and how to access public transport in the area.  The bakery, grocer, mini market and cafe shops were only 5 mins away and were excellent.  Getting the the main sites was simple (a 20mins walk or a 10min metro ride), it was wonderful to be so close to everything.  We were very comfortable in the apartment - it was clean, stylish, safe and well equipped for cooking.  We enjoyed every moment we were there, felt very relaxed and Roula was an excellent host.  We would definitely stay there again."
155271,550607,2011-09-20,960344,Tiina,"The appartment was great! Roula was so kind and helpful. Easy to go everywhere with the metro or bus. There was also delicious restaurants near by. We stayed here with our 2 year old son and we would definitely recommed this place. We had really nice Athens experince.
Thanks! best wishes, Tiina, Mick & Jesse from Belgium"

155271,561230,2011-09-23,1184198,David,"Roula's place is perfect - great location, great apartment, great host.  Will be our first port of call in Athens in future."
155271,570342,2011-09-26,1097973,Jan,"Roula's apart,net was charming and comfortable, and only two stops from the parthenon and downtown shopping areas. She sent me tons of great info on the neighborhood and transportation before our arrival and was quick to respond to lingering questions via email on demand. Best of all she helped my travel companions plan a special surprise birthday celebration for me, making reservations for us at a fabulous place and even called the restaurant to make sure we had arrived and were enjoying our meal! I highly recommend her place!"
155271,581884,2011-09-29,814339,Carley,Roula was just the most amazing host! Invaluable advice for Athens and life in general. Even my Mum wanted to hug her from Australia for looking after her daughter so well. The apartment is awesome too!
155271,588747,2011-10-02,655144,Pei Sien,"I stayed here for a night on our last day in Greece.
Roula's apartment is great.  Clean, comfortable and cozy.  It is what is seen on the pictures, with enough space to move around comfortably.   It's almost like staying in a serviced apartment.

Roula has been very accomodating to welcome us very early in the morning when we arrive.  Thank you for that !

I would recommend her apartment as a place to rest your foot in Athens !
"
155271,594738,2011-10-03,304888,Leah,"Lovely place right near the American embassy in Athens.  Just two metro stops away from Plaka and all of the downtown hussle and bussle - with the protests going strong in that area, Roula's place was a great location to be in, to get out of the way of it all but still be relatively close.  The thing that impressed me the most about the place was all of the recommendations she gave!  Be sure to try at least one of the restaurants and shops she recommends...  Truly a great visit and am looking forward to my next visit to Athens and to Roula's place!  Bisous de la France xx"
155271,597574,2011-10-04,1028093,Marcos,"Roula has a very cozy apartment in a convenient location. We had a short stay, and unfortunately we had not the chance to meet Roula in person, but she was in contact/available through email and phone in any moment, looking for us to have a pleasant stay."
155271,626928,2011-10-13,468891,Lise,"à notre première visite à Athène, nous n'aurions pas pu mieux tomber.
Nous avons magasiné l'appartement via AIRBNB, comme nous avions fait pour SanFrancisco, au printemps.
Ce système permet de trouver des sites où le rapport qualité-prix est mis en lien avec la localisation.
Dans ce cas-ci, l'appartement de Roula s'avérait être très central aussi. De là, on pouvait  facilement se véhiculer vers l'aéroport, le centre-ville, et les monuments, le quartier PLAKA.... et ceci dans des temps très raisonnables.
Quant à l'appartement, il était propre et moderne. Tout y est neuf.
Les lits sont de très bonne qualité. Roula a vu à tout.
Nous avons d'ailleurs eu le plaisir de rencontrer Roula et de recevoir encore plus d'information. Elle est très sympathique..
Nous avons couché là trois soirs avant d'aller à Santorini et Pharos, et y sommes revenus la veille du départ.
Nous alons certainement retourner chez Roula et y référer nos amis.

Lise et Guy, Saint-Lambert, Québec, Canada."
155271,670232,2011-10-28,846449,Jim,Roula is very welcoming and informative.  Very great communication from helping you choose a restaurant to assisting with how to get to the airport by bus. A food tour she recommended was great. Apartment very well equipped and a quiet location just out of the main action.  close to transit. Good restaurants nearby.  She has put together a great little book of info that is available to guests.  Generous with supplies like coffee.
155271,686779,2011-11-02,1223234,Charisma,"One of the best deals in our Athens trip was Roula's place.  Her apartment was a home away from home, so nice and cosy. I almost didn't want to leave =;-)  It was also accessible, near to the city center but without the hustle and bustle.
Roula, indeed, is a wonderful host. Although we didn't get to meet her personally, she made sure that everything was organized accordingly and that we have everything we needed around the apartment.
Definitely will recommend her place to all my friends =)"
155271,757210,2011-12-01,1256557,Andreas,"We spent more than three months in Roula's apartment. Together with our little daughter. I can say it's a perfect place also for a longterm stay. In the morning you wake up with the sunshine on your huge balcony and you have bright light till the late afternoon. The heating works, you have air condition in both rooms and cable TV with more channels you can watch. In 15 minutes you are by foot in the center and within five minutes by car without traffic jam on the main roads to the sea coast. There is a nice fitness club two blocks away. To make it short: We would rent the place again."
155271,1092197,2012-04-07,1540516,Charles,"We actually stayed in Roula's new apartment near the Acropolis, not this one. The one we had was excellent, clean and child friendly. The location is great, walkable to most tourist sites and with easy access to the metro. The little garden at the back is a real gem which allows you to sit our at night or in the morning. We had all of our home meals there. We would recommend it for a couple with/without one child without hesitation. Any problems and Roula is very attentive and hospitable. "
155271,1269548,2012-05-13,878046,Francis,"Due to last minute repairs, we were unable to occupy this apartment.  However, our host Roula put us in another apartment which was more than satisfactory (Walk on the Acropolis Side.) I will review our host who furnished a sparkling clean apartment with every possible amenity.  She quickly secured the couple of items I wanted in order to do a lot of cooking. She was very attentive but not at all obtrusive. It's hard to believe how anxious she was that we have a good experience during our month-long stay. I would highly recommend renting from Roula. "
155271,1520096,2012-06-19,2597956,Deborah,"This is a lovely apartment with a homely feel to it. The balcony overlooks a courtyard-type area, which means you are not overlooked and in the mornings you hear birdsong rather than traffic noise (a rarity for the centre of Athens).

The apartment is in a safe area, just off Vasilissis Sofias Ave, which is a 30 second walk away and has regular buses running up and down it.  The Megaro Moussikis metro station is approximately a 10 minute walk away, so it’s conveniently located for public transport.  There’s a supermarket a 2 minute walk away, which has an ATM machine, plus there are plenty of places to eat within about a 5 minute walk.

Roula is based in Cyprus so I only communicated with her via email, however, I met her daughter Ellie who greets you at the apartment.  Both are lovely and very responsive if you have any queries.  Roula also made suggestions of places to visit or events that may be of interest to you, in addition to the file of useful information provided in the apartment.

After I’d moved in a friend came round to visit.  She liked the apartment so much that she decided to book it after I’d moved out.

I can’t fault Roula, Ellie or the apartment and would be very happy to stay there again."
155271,1561067,2012-06-25,2486858,Andie,"Everything you could possible want or need for a stay in Athens. Handy to the metro and airport bus. Very comfortable apartment, everything worked perfectly."
155271,1625133,2012-07-03,2522044,Myanthi,"It was a great experience as the place was very comfortable. It was a fair distance to walk to the metro station.Apart from this everything else was very good. After a tiring day in the city it was such a pleasure to come back to our lovely apartment.
The hostess was absolutely charming with two charming daughters.Three of them were always prepared to help and offering assistance .
I will recommend the place anyday to anyone "
155271,1645301,2012-07-06,2486858,Andie,Roula was a pleasure to deal with yet again. Any extra requests were dealt with very efficiently and in a friendly manner. If I am back in Athens I will certainly return here. Many thanks.
155271,1686656,2012-07-11,2785612,Isobel,"Roula couldn't have been more helpful! She has bent over backwards to make my stay in Athens as easy and comfortable as possible. Even giving extra tips about what's on in Athens this week - what exhibitions to see. etc.
The apartment is a gem, beautifully arranged and a little oasis in the middle of the city. Have felt really relaxed and at home here. Didn't want to go home!
She was also super flexible about the length of my stay - when I wasn't quite sure how my trip would pan out or how many days I would want the apartment for.
Couldn't ask for a better host A*************"
155271,1719692,2012-07-16,239104,Premasagar,"Roula's apartment is fantastic. It's tidy, well-equipped and has not only a comfy bed but also a comfy sofa bed!

The apartment is about 10 minutes walk from the Metro, and then two Metro stops away from the centre of Athens.

Roula's daughter, Ellie, gave us loads of useful tips for seeing things in Athens, and we had a very enjoyable stay."
155271,1799706,2012-07-25,2887800,Marion,"The appartment had everything we needed. When we arrived the fridge was already filled with some basic things, like milk fruit and honey. Also there's a supermarket around the corner, and a metro station and subway nearby."
155271,1872614,2012-08-02,2863814,Kris,"Looking at the picture I wish I was back in Athens relaxing with the French doors open looking out at the garden below.....
This place is a peaceful little sanctuary. Just off a major road, so easy for transport, yet just behind the other buildings, so no street noise!! And looking down onto the gardens of two other buildings, green in the middle of the city.
Beyond all of that, Roula is the sort of person who really just wants to make your time in Athens a joy.  She seems to have had some little treat for everyone here, me too! She travels enough to know what kind of information is helpful and how to take away the stresses of travel. She will bend over backwards to help you.
Looking forward to my return already!"
155271,2222710,2012-09-07,2785612,Isobel,"2nd time I've stayed at this delightful apartment and it felt like home from home. Nothing is too much trouble for this host.
Thank you again Roula!"
155271,2414011,2012-09-25,3186827,Arlen And Tara,"Roula was an amazing host and I couldn't ask for any more from the experience: super conveniently located, near shops and restaurants, and a very comfortable and modern launching pad for maximizing the most out of my brief 3 day vacation in between work jaunts.

Roula's tips and above-and-beyond care really made the trip. Having done no research into the local culture, I relied pretty much solely on her recommendations and was never once disappointed. She even looked up the bus schedule to Delphi and suggested the best local restaurant for pies upon arrival. Very much recommended and I look forward to a return visit!!"
155271,2451419,2012-09-30,1496502,Judy,"We had a wonderful stay at Roula's apartment.  It is stylish, and so comfortable that we ate in every night.  A grocery store is within walking distance.  It is a great location and a safe neighborhood.  It is off the main street just enough to be quiet and peaceful.  Most of all, Roula  and her daughter were extremely helpful in every way.  They went out of their way to print some documents for us.  We loved Greece and the people and always felt safe there.  Would love to come back again and if we do will definitely stay  with  Roula."
155271,2550522,2012-10-08,2822345,Neni,A very convinient location for those who would like a taste of the urbun way of living in Athens. Some of the trendiest little bars are just around the corner at Mavilli Square as well as Lycabettus Hill for great walks and the Athens Concert Hall where there is a something always on. A big choice of buses and Metro subway plus taxis will take you anywhere you like. Roula is a great host and always available to help if there is any need. Coffee and cookies were much appreciated!
155271,2582693,2012-10-11,1927180,Shanna,"Sorry for the delay in replying but since returning home I've been very sick. I wish I'd stayed in Greece!! Anyway, Roula is a wonderfully organised host and the apartment is great. We loved the fact it overlooked an inner city garden. Such a nice surprise. Roula is 100% committed to ensuring her guests have everything they need and nothing was too much trouble. The only reasons we didn't give 5 stars are I didn't like the old elevator, the foyer had a bad smell and the street was very dark where the entrance to the building is. Nothing that our dear host can change. In fact if I could give 4 and 1/2 stars I would. The apartment was excellant value for money, close to public transport and other ammenities and super clean. Despite our bad timing (the german Chancellor was in town so the city was in lock down) we had a fantastic time in Athens and look forward to spending more time there when we next go to Europe."
155271,2605161,2012-10-14,1784560,Gareth,"The apartment is located in the quiet side of athens, but highly accessible by bus and metro. Roula was responsive to our enquiries and even provided us with useful informations. The apartment is spacious to accomodate 4 of us. Highly recommended to everyone! "
155271,2650256,2012-10-18,3492702,Ivana,"This was the best thoughtout apartment ever!  Met anyone's needs in a compact and modern way.  Great location.....we walked and took the metro everywhere.  Roula's husband was waiting for us at the apartment...we arrived at night.  A bottle of wine, cookies and a souvenir were waiting for us. A wonderful experience. "
155271,2771892,2012-10-31,1276751,Caroline,"Nous sommes arrivés vers Minuit à l'appartement et Roula était là pour nous accueillir! Première bonne surprise...
Comme nous sommes arrivés tard, il y avait de quoi petit-déjeuner pour le lendemain.
Roula était très disponible pour nous, nous a commandé un taxi pour notre départ et nous a même offert une bouteille de vin grec et un petit souvenir.
Merci Roula! "

Upon our arrival, we were surprised to find a welcome bottle of very good wine and delicious biscuits. Roula was very supportive and helpful and made sure we were comfortable.

155271,3411342,2013-01-25,4577259,Ivan,"Right place to stay in Athens. Near the city center, but in a really quiet street. Apartment is lovely, clean and furnished with a great taste. Perfect grocery store is nearby and kitchen is fully equipped so you can prepare what ever you want. We did :)
Roula is very good host. She organized a cot for our baby boy, sent us lot of useful information, and updated us daily on changes in public transport caused by strikes.
Perfect apartment. Excellent host. Great city.    "

155271,3615586,2013-02-26,3935248,Christine,"L'appartement est idéal pour un séjour à Athènes. Il est très bien situé et très fonctionnel (il ne manque rien, on se sent comme à la maison ! ). Il est spatieux et sans vis-à-vis : deux fenêtres donnent sur des jardins où l'on peut voir oiseaux et tortues évoluer.
Roula est adorable et très accueillante. Son esprit pratique et son expérience facilite beaucoup le séjour.
Je recommande cet appartement à tous !"
155271,3687553,2013-03-04,4965086,Vidic,"The apartment was beautiful, clean .. Everything we needed had. We are also surprised by the little things which.. it all!"

From a first aid kit, to books on Greek cooking and welcome bottle of wine and little gift, it made staying there such a pleasure. The apartment was clean, cozy, comfortable and in a great location.

"
155271,4280865,2013-04-24,471806,Kristen,"I had a great time at Roula's. The apt is very well adapted for a single person or a young couple. Even if the weather is dismal or you want to stay indoors for the evening, the place is a nice quiet den. It is about two miles from the central area but it's an easy walk or short bus ride. Also Roula is very easy to talk to and manages her apt very politely and professionally. Definitely worth a return visit. "

It had everything we needed and some nice extras.  The acropolis was only a few minutes away and the metro was conveniently close and very easy to use.  We wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.  The people of Athens were also exceedingly friendly and courteous, surprising for a large city.  It's a great place for a vacation."

Roula left us a wonderful notebook with suggestions for restaurants, markets, shopping and more.  She was kind enough to provide special pillows for my husband, due to his allergies.  Our first experience with airbnb was a great one!  Be sure to try the Cretan restaurant (#13 vrasida) behind the Hilton hotel.  Great suggestion by our host."

Also she provided a nice bottle of wine for our enjoyment upon arrival in Athens. Roula had taken time to organize informational notebooks detailing food and restaurant recommendations as well as entertainment and sites recommendations. She also provided books and pamphlets about Athens that were quite helpful for our stay. If you are planning a trip to Athens, you will do yourself a favor if you rent this apartment from Roula!"

We stayed two nights in Roula's place and were so happy about everything: The location, the style, the equipment and the balcony on which we had our happy hours. It is quiet and extremely clean. After a long day of walking in Athens, we were all excited to go back and relax there. We have two girls and they slept very well on the large and comfortable sofa. We highly recommend Roula's place. Plus her charming daughter who welcomed us was extremely kind and helpful. Great stay, thanks a lot Roula! Maud and family"

"
155271,6319010,2013-08-08,5831458,Lene,"We stayed at Roula's place for 8 nights and we enjoyed every moment of it. Safe neighbourhood and conveniently located close to public transport (also to the airport).
We arrived quite late but Roula was there and made us feel very welcome. Fresh fruit, water in the fridge and cookies is just part of the service. Everything in the flat  is in good working order and WIFI was fast. Roula kept in contact and was on hand with good information and tips. "
155271,6363765,2013-08-10,493822,Laura,"E' la nostra prima vacanza con airbnb e l'esperienza e' stata ottima.
L'appartamento di Roula è esattamente come descritto dalle foto, accogliente, luminoso, molto personale, attrezzato per ogni necessita' e pulitissimo.
Ha un bel terrazzino che affaccia sul verde di una ambasciata.
La location e' perfetta,è vicino alla metro che porta sia in centro che all'aeroporto.Facendo una passeggiata siamo andati al museo bizantino, al museo Benaki e poi fino a Monastiraki.Atene vi aspetta per essere scoperta e questa casa e' una ottima base per cominciare.
Roula,la proprietaria, e' una persona gradevolissima che vi consigliera' al meglio, e' come una fatina che vi aiutera' a vivere la favola!
Roula parla un eccellente italiano per cui la comunicazione e' facilissima e veloce.
Ritorneremo."
155271,6535729,2013-08-16,5489697,Tom,"Roula was a very kind and informative host. We arrived quite late into Piraeus port, Roula gave us detailed written instructions in English and Greek to give to the taxi driver to get us to the apartment. The apartment was clean and spacious enough for a couple and a third wheel. The place is a few minutes walk to the bus stop, where there are many services into town ( including the x95 which goes to the airport). Thank you for the stay."
155271,6866231,2013-08-28,3342930,Jeny,We had a wonderful time while we stay in the Roula's Apt. It's a cozy and beautiful apt as it shows in the picture. Roula is the best host that take care all we need. The apt is convenient to the most attractions. Thanks Roula!!!!

She was very helpful from the start, sending lots of information about where to shop, eat and explore.  She met me when I arrived and had tea and cookies as well as a bottle of wine for our stay.  Her place is very relaxing and we felt at home the entire time.  I would visit again and recommend her highly."
155271,7113171,2013-09-07,6550511,Laura,"I stayed in Roula's Athens apartment for 3 days with 3 friends. We had a very enjoyable stay! The apartment was very close to public transport so it was easy to get to the airport and the landmarks e.g. the Acropolis. It was also very homely, with lots of personal touches, including biscuits and wine in the kitchen provided, and plenty of toiletries for us to use.

Roula really went above and beyond to help us out, even though we never met in person. Before we arrived, she sent us a list of activities and places to eat in Athens. I also had trouble booking train tickets to my next destination and she kindly allowed me to have them sent to her private address, where they were then hand delivered to me by her daughter on arrival. Could not have asked for a more genial host!"
155271,7223061,2013-09-11,3143622,Genevieve,Roula was amazing and stayed in communication the whole time. The location is amazing and so convenient to get whatever you need. The apartment was immaculate and well kept and really made us feel at home. Can't wait to go back so we can stay again

155271,7303150,2013-09-15,7496095,Ann Kathleen,"I wholeheartedly recommend staying at Roula’s apartment in Athens. It is in a nice neighborhood and easy to reach from the airport by metro or bus. It is perfect for a couple and it is nicely decorated with some very excellent paintings on the walls. I particularly enjoyed waking up to a lovely landscape in the bedroom and I also adored the curtains in the living room (I love fabric). The apartment is quiet and my husband and I slept very well—important so that you get the most of visiting Athens by day (and well into the night!). While I did not get the chance to meet Roula (hopefully on another occasion), we were in regular communication from the day we made the reservation and she provided us with a wealth of information. Her recommendations are excellent. We followed her lead on several occasions and really appreciated the information. Roula’s warmth and desire to share her city was evident in our exchanges and I can’t wait to visit again.

Enjoyed 3 of the several movie DVDs as well.

Apartment is located in a good neighbourhood with a Metro stop within easy walking distance.  There are several market  and grocery stores nearby as well as restaurants to choose from.

The location was excellent: close to Metro station, bus stops, grocery stores, pharmacies, bakeries, bars, coffee shops, banks and much more.
During our 2 weeks stay, we walked to the coffee shop after dinner and stayed until 10 pm many nights. Walking around the condo at night was absolutely safe.

Before our arrival and during our stay, Ralou constantly sent us detailed information of places to go, things to do, things to watch out, reminders, etc. She is truly SUPER HOSTESS!!

We will go back to Athens and will book her condo again in the future.

It's a very nice apartment, corresponding to the pictures online, clean, with enough space for at least 3 persons, a nice balcony for the afternoon/evening sun, calm, and Ralou is a wonderful host, very helpful and rapidly responding if there's anything you may need. Supermarkets, bakerys etc are very close to the apartment, as well as metro and bus stations, which makes it very easy to visit Athens. If you prefer walking, no problem at all, the apartment is close enough to everything, I highly recommend as a start to walk to Kolonaki square and up Lycavittos hill, where you have a wonderful view on Athens."

155271,16959848,2014-08-04,2983976,Sercan,Ralou is the most amazing hosts ever. She managed everything in the house extrenly well. Her house is pretty good for 3-4 day stay. The center of Athens is a bit confusing as where you define center is. If you think center is Akropolis you need to take a 4 euro taxi from the house. House enviroment is so good you can reach to many places market bakery shopping area etc. very easily.  If you have a ca there is no car parking problem. The only thing is you need to be quiet for the neighbours...

She arranged transport for us from and to the airport, and provided many local insights for restaurants and shops. She was very responsive and helpful. We would definitely stay in one of her units again!"
155271,20132718,2014-09-24,12262570,George,"A very nice, clean apartment, centrally located for easy access to most of Athens. 4 euro taxi rides will get you most anywhere...10 minute walk to metro...main bus route to Acropolis just a walk to the corner.  Off the main thoroughfare enough to give you a quiet peaceful rest.. Easy access to local markets and restaurants.  You really can't miss with this rental. Lots of tips from Ralou that are right on target"
155271,20405257,2014-09-29,12687723,Mario,"We had a great time in Athens! The apartment is conveniently located within a 15 minute walk of the metro station and there are a couple of supermarkets close by in case you need to buy something. Ralou is very helpful - her travel tips are really useful - and she was kind enough to stock the fridge with a lovely breakfast and a four pack of beer (a nice thing to find when you arrive after a long flight at 10 in the night). I would certainly recommend this as a great place to stay, especially for small families. "
155271,20870328,2014-10-06,14091835,James,"The apartment is in a great location and very close to the metro and buses but within walking distances to a lot of places. Ralou left a folder with tips on local restaurants and Mr Baker nearby with is a wonderful bakery. The apartment is very quiet with a nice deck in the sun. It was very clean and comfortable. We thoroughly recommend it and if we go back to Athens we would have no hesitation in staying there again.

Thank you again Ralou, you are a wonderful host

155271,21059420,2014-10-10,22087025,Maria,Η περιγραφή ήταν ακριβής  η γειτονιά πολύ καλή και η οικοδέσποινα έκανε τα πάντα για να νιώθουμε σαν το σπίτι μας
155271,21631088,2014-10-20,14705641,Patti,"Ralou responded to my emails very quickly and sent, in advance of our arrival, detailed information about Athens, our flat and our neighborhood including places to eat, things to do and had a special gift waiting for us! She was unable to meet us herself but arranged for a knowledgable and helpful person to assist us when we arrived.  Ralou was extremely accessible and made extra efforts to communicate - calling us shortly after our arrival to make sure everything went smoothly.  The apt. Was very quiet especially considering how close we were to a very busy, high traffic, main thoroughfare. It was nicely appointed and clean.
"
155271,21940333,2014-10-27,18243772,Dawn,"From the initial contact to the very last minute I knew that I was in for a special experience. Ralou took care of my every question and request, from helpful ideas on where to visit, organising me a taxi transfer on arrival and putting lovely coffee and fruit in the apartment for my convenience.
The location is perfect, a half an hour walk into the centre of the city with a metro and all that is needed nearby.
The apartment is beautifully appointed and every consideration has been taken to ensure a comfortable stay. Great wifi! And the sunshine that comes in throughout the day makes for a happy welcome feeling. As does the balcony and garden below.
I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Athens and hope to return for a longer visit next time. Thank you so much for welcoming me like a friend! Loved your city. And highly recommend your apartment to any visitors to it."
155271,24078230,2014-12-19,12192555,Emily & Alex,"A stay at Ralou’s was the perfect introduction to Athens. We were greeted with a plate of Greek Christmas cookies and a phone call from Ralou to ensure we had arrived safely. We appreciated her tips (especially about where to eat) and her attentive communication before and during our stay.

The apartment is a beautiful blend of old and new. The best feature is the balcony overlooking a garden, which we were able to enjoy even in winter. Despite our short stay, we truly felt at home thanks to Ralou’s hospitality and would happily stay again. Σας ευχαριστώ πολύ!
"
155271,26478838,2015-02-14,23200102,Eleni,"Ralou kept in touch to ensure I was comfortable and had everything I need.
Listing was accurate - a lovely and cosy apartment, close to everything.
"
155271,27123347,2015-02-26,10782628,Audrey,"The apartment was comfortable and in a great location 5 minutes way from the Athens convention center and a pleasant 40 minute stroll to the sights and downtown. Ralou provided so much information before our arrival and took care to contact us after, we always felt we were in really good hands. She was a pleasure to deal with from beginning to end. Bed was incredibly comfortable and the apartment was clean and well stocked with everything we need for a 4 day business trip. "
155271,29171651,2015-04-05,24613811,Rachel,"Very comfortable apartment in an excellent area in easy walking distance of shops, restaurants, banks, bus stops (very close to the airport bus stop) and metro line into central Athens.

Ralou was away when we arrived but made sure we were greeted warmly on arrival and then rang us as soon as she was able to ensure everything was going well.

The bed is very comfortable, the living/dining area very stylish and I enjoyed a few hours, reading some of the books provided, on the sunny balcony which overlooks a nearby garden.

The small kitchen had pretty much everything you could need,
even including a selection of tea and coffee, and the shower room was clean and the water kept warm for some time after heating.

All in all a good choice!

"
155271,31314244,2015-05-04,2204326,Petra,"Een fijn appartement in een fijne buurt. Schoon, netjes, rustig. Ralou zorgt ervoor dat haar gasten zich snel thuisvoelen. We komen zeker terug. "
155271,32370611,2015-05-17,21394594,Carole,This was our first visit to Athens (for a conference at the Hilton Hotel) and we were very pleased with the location and amenities of Ralou's apartment.  The kitchen was well equipped and the washing machine was a lifesaver during the week.  The balcony was glorious for relaxing under the Athens sun while enjoying a glass of wine after a long days of sightseeing/conference.  The proximity to the Metro and airport bus stop was ideal and within walking distance to the Hilton Hotel.  Ralou greeted us as family and provided a wealth of local information before and during our stay.  This is our fourth Airbnb and the experiences continue to be memorable.
155271,35561918,2015-06-20,4203218,Christine,Ralou was the perfect host. Responses to emails were immediate and she provided me with lots of valuable information in advance. She and her lovely daughter welcomed me warmly at the appartment. The flat was very clean and the location was perfect for attending a congress at the Megaron Center and just a few stations away from the city centre. I highly recommend this place!
155271,36047604,2015-06-24,35392290,Vanessa,"Our stay was wonderful. The apartment was exactly as described and was clean, neat, and ready with every detail you can think of. There was tea, instant coffee and 2 types of cookies to greet us (wonderful as we were so hungry when we arrived on Sunday evening and every market closed!). Steps from all bus lines and metro service around entire city. For Americans it is also good to note that it was close to the American Embassy (we did not go there) and for Serbians, it was also close to Serbian embassy (among other embassies) so we used those locations to navigate our way back to apartment. I would definitely stay here again as everything was perfect and Ralou and her daughter were so hospitable and kind! "
155271,37032489,2015-07-04,26984712,Bianca,"Excellent communication throughout stay and before. Great apartment close to Metro and shops, would highly recommend."
3326903,24057766,2014-12-18,24268980,Rachel,"This was a lovely, comfortable apartment with towels provided. Eleni met me at the apartment when I arrived and provided me with maps of the surrounding area and places I had already told her I was likely to visit. The area was great for an extended stay, with a supermarket literally in the same building and a whole range of useful and attractive shops on the main street just a minute's walk away. There were regular buses and plentiful taxis from the main street and the Metro (only a few short stops from central Athens) was an easy 15 minute walk. The apartment itself was beautifully decorated with one double bedroom, a single bedroom/study plus a very comfortable sofa where it would be possible to sleep. The shower room was immaculate. There was a very large balcony too. Very pleased I  chose this accommodation and that Eleni allowed me to stay. Thank you! "
3326903,24560128,2014-12-30,7681550,Yoav,"The apartment is beautiful, new, quiet, spacious and clean - and the balcony is huge and lovely to relax on. We really enjoyed staying there and celebrating Christmas. The check-in was perfect as well, Eleni gave us directions and answered all our questions. The location was a 20 min walk to the nearest metro station and 3 stops to the city center. The apartment is a short walk to a street with plenty of shops, supermarkets and restaurants, so it's easy to get supplies and eat out. Also the taxis are very affordable and there were plenty of them.
Thanks a lot to Eleni who was very nice, extremely helpful and flexible about our needs (she for example arranged for a baby cot) and our check-out time."
3326903,26189417,2015-02-06,7906053,Nina,"This is a great place: extremely clean and with all new and trendy furniture and equipment. Also, the house provides a lot of practical items that are not standard like paper kitchen towels, a wide range of herbs and alcholic drinks. You can see that Eleni has put a lot of love in it. The environment is nice too. Very close to a street with shops and cafes, I felt safe walking around here at night."
3326903,30013983,2015-04-16,9077247,Georgios,"The apartment of Eleni was undoubtedly the nicest place I have ever stayed using Airbnb (and I have used  it quite a lot!). It is very nicely  decorated and has anything a visitor would need for a short or longer stay. Spacious, with a very big balcony and close to the city center (using transportation). Eleni was very helpful with anything I needed. She even sent me a new iron and hairdryer when I asked for it! Very friendly and informative. If I revisit Athens, I won't think twice about where to stay!"

Ολα είναι καινούργια ,το μπάνιο υπέροχο, η κουζίνα πολύ λειτουργική το στρώμα στο διπλό κρεβάτι καταπληκτικό.Η βεράντα τεράστια.
Η οικοδομή πολύ ήσυχη και περιποιημένη.Μεγάλη ευκολία το σουπερ μαρκετ ακριβώς από κάτω.Η γειτονιά γεμάτη εύρωστα καταστήματα.

L'appartement est agréable, bien orienté et confortable, dans un quartier animé avec des commerces de proximité. Sa situation à 4 stations de bus de la station de métro la plus proche n'est pas un inconvénient car les bus sont nombreux et l'appartement reste central pour accéder aux différents lieux touristiques et quasiment direct de l'aéroport.
La pharmacienne la plus proche parle anglais et offre des conseils précieux en cas de souci de santé.
Merci pour les bons moments passés."
3326903,33921914,2015-06-02,29526609,Joanne,"What a beautiful, light and spacious apartment! We spent 2 weeks here and had the most wonderful time. Eleni met us at the apartment when we arrived at 10pm at night, greeting us like old friends. The apartment felt so warm and welcoming - even better than the photographs led me to expect, and had everything we would need. It was extremely clean and very comfortable, and the large terrace was a welcome surprise. The area feels very safe with plenty of bakeries, coffee shops and supermarkets, with a taxi into other areas just a quick wave away. In general, people were so friendly and I lost count of the times people openly talked to me and particularly my 2 year old daughter. We had such a good time and will treasure the memories of our time in Athens."
3326903,35694215,2015-06-21,34378482,Ivan,"Eleni was a great host and went out of her way to help me. The apartment was better than the images advertised and was very clean and homely. The area itself is in a good location with a variety of shops nearby, while the metro is only a short walking distance away. Overall i had a great experience and would definitely recommend this apartment and Eleni to anyone interested. "
3326903,37205021,2015-07-05,20248113,Kilian,Stayed there for one week and everything was  perfect.
1272844,6406640,2013-08-11,7793497,Andreas,"Attending a congress in town, I spent an entire week in Katerina's small hostel in Mets. I greatly enjoyed my stay. Even though we were both busy, Katerina still managed to find the time for an occasional chat over a cup of coffee. The rooftop garden is simply beautiful. And the place did indeed feel like a small hostel. It was exactly what I had looked for."
1272844,7144557,2013-09-08,8222056,Natu,"Estuvimos 2 noches en el Hostel. Katerina es una persona entrañable y servicial, que nos dio muy buenos consejos durante nuestra estancia en Atenas.

Se trata de una habitación completamente independiente y tranquila, con baño y un pequeño horno-cocina, situado a escasos minutos del centro de la ciudad. Está en el patio de la casa que es precioso."
1272844,7499744,2013-09-22,8892487,Dina,"We stayed in Katerina's hostel for one night. we arrived late at night, and katerina was very kind and tried to help us. although we were late for more than an hour, a friend of katerina's waited for us till we arrived. the neighborhood is very nice.
But, unfortunately we found a small room, very hot and full with mosquitoes. the shower was so small. that basically you need to stand on the toilet.
We will not stay there again.   "
1272844,7882908,2013-10-07,6758620,Sylvain," Warmly welcomed  by Katerina , I could feel like home in this ""little ,tiny private house"" in the garden/courtyard of Katerina's house...
Mets is an excellent location for being very close to the city center and enjoy a non-touristic (but genuine) area of Athens with a ""village atmosphere"" (shops, cafes...)
"
1272844,8157089,2013-10-18,8136834,Jane,"I really enjoyed my stay at Katerina's. I stayed for a full week and found it was in a very nice area, very quiet at night so one could sleep well. I always got the trolley bus into Syntagma square which was easy (no's 2, 4, 11)  any time of day or night. At night I could wander around Mets feeling very safe. Amazingly only 5 mins walk to the renowned jazz club: Half Note !! Lots of nice tavernas, bars etc. in Mets. Katerina was friendly, and kindly helped me with my Greek. The small hostel was great for one person but two people could easily have been comfortable there.   Megaritis is an excellent place to eat dinner.  I would definitely stay there again."
1272844,8240004,2013-10-21,402502,Sarah,"We stayed at Katerina's studio for one night, the location is perfect for a brief visit and very well connected. The area is nice and communication with Katerina went smoothly. The terrace on the roof is amazing, a pity not having time to enjoy breakfast up there! The studio doesn't look exactly like the pictures and shower is a bit uncomfortable, but it's still perfect if you need an easy place to stay in the city. "
1272844,11151679,2014-03-23,12169915,Andrea,"Katerina's was warm and friendly despite my arrival and stay on a particularly busy weekend of hers. The guest house was spacious and cozy and a treat to stay in-- the only hiccup was a slightly dated bathroom, but it functioned perfectly nonetheless. All in all a great stay, I only wish I could have visited Athens for longer!"
1272844,12192562,2014-04-25,1483661,Kristen,"I visited with Katerina during Easter, and I was so warmly welcomed by her and her family. The location is amazing; Mets is a fantastic place to take walks, enjoy cafes, to wander. It's very easy to get to the more touristy areas of the city, but the Katerina's neighborhood is more quiet and residential. Two bustling squares are a 5-minute walk away, if you want to enjoy dinner and drinks out. The apartment is small, but perfect for a short stay. I cooked dinner each night there. There's a convection oven with two burners and a fridge, but it's not a kitchen-lover's kitchen. The set-up is a bit challenging. I ate dinner on the lovely patio and rooftop terrace, and Katerina very kindly invited me in to share coffee and a chat each night. It was a very pleasant stay overall."
1272844,12735384,2014-05-09,7640651,Elodie,Perfect time with katerina highly recommanded
1272844,12858509,2014-05-12,4919832,Adeline,"L'appartement est très agréable et plutôt bien situé dans un quartier calme.
Il est à 15min a pied du quartier Plaka.
Nous avons bien été accueilli avec une limonade faite avec les citrons du jardin.
Rapport qualité / prix intéressant pour un appartement proche des quartiers touristiques d'Athènes.

1272844,13514093,2014-05-29,6820459,Hannes,"Very friendly welcome. We enjoyed the roof terrace and the location near the central, on a good walking distance. Try the Odeon Bar nearby for the first coffee  in the evening and the last drink on the way home. "
1272844,13927612,2014-06-08,8540859,Sally,"Very nice room in wonderful neighborhood.  Only a few minutes walk from the Acropolis and other tourist sites but feels far removed from tourist areas.
Katerina was very welcoming and helpful. "
1272844,14288788,2014-06-16,8082220,Atiyé,Small as it says - and cosy. You get a feeling of living in Athens when you stay here.
1272844,14533821,2014-06-21,1133327,Sophia,"Perfect. A lovely welcome from Katerina with homemade lemonade. The neighbourhood was peaceful, pretty and very central. The place was great - a real sanctuary amidst the heat and stress of Athens. Whole hearted recommendation from us.
Thanks Katerina! "
1272844,14802993,2014-06-26,13759847,Corien,"The stay at Katerina's place was perfect: the little studio was fine, private and clean, on walking distance to the Acropolis, and above all Katerina made me feel very welcome by inviting me in her kitchen activities...  I really can recommend her place to others who want to get an impression of local life in Athens. "
1272844,15230419,2014-07-05,1239167,Basia,"I had a fantastic stay at Katerina's Athens studio. I felt welcome straight away. The studio is wonderful, with everything you need including fresh coffee and a stove top coffee maker. It was comfortable and clean. The neighbourhood was great, walking distance to all attractions and a lovely atmosphere on the local streets. I started my stay jetlagged roaming the cemetery and old olympic stadium which was delightful. A very enjoyable stay and I would come back. Thank you Katerina :)"
1272844,15976172,2014-07-19,17221470,Anna,"Charming little house, with a gorgeous, plant-filled courtyard to sit in. The neighborhood is really sweet-- cool coffee shops and things only a few blocks away, and all the museums and sites within walking distance. Hosts were incredibly welcoming, helpful and kind, and the studio was private while being close to the larger house, so that I felt they were there should any need arise. I would stay again-- a perfect way to land in Athens. Many thanks!"
1272844,16358501,2014-07-26,3035468,Joshua,Katerina's place was perfect for our stay in Athens. The space was clean and had everything we needed. Within walking distance from the Acropolis and the metro. Katerina's boyfriend greeted us with homemade lemonade and then brought us some delicious Greek dishes he had made himself. The neighborhood was quiet and full of shops and cafés. The only issue we had was that the wireless connection was not very strong. We had a great stay and would recommend Katerina's place to anyone staying in Athens.
1272844,17096960,2014-08-07,11725794,Meredith,We loved our stay at Katerina's flat. The neighborhood was wonderful -- a good grocery and bakery and good restaurants -- and ideally located for walking to all the sites in the Athens. The flat was clean and quiet and Katerina and her friends Nikos and Panos were very helpful. We did have some trouble with Mosquitos so bug spray was a must.

1272844,18943383,2014-09-03,13798897,René,Accueil très chaleureux. On se sent rapidement chez soi. Katerina est très attentionnée et nous avons aimé le raisin et  les pistaches fraîches si gentiment offerts!  La maison est très calme et bien située. Les conseils et les bonnes adresses de Katerina rendent le séjour agréable. Totalement recommandé pour un bon moment a Athènes.
1272844,19531420,2014-09-14,19017822,Anthony,Thank you it was a nice accomodation with kindness and hospitality!!
1272844,20012796,2014-09-22,2579118,Sylviane,Appartamento molto carino ed accogliente. Il quartiere è tranquillo e piacevole con ottimi piccoli ristoranti. Katerina è una persona discreta e ospitale. Abbiamo apprezzato molto la possibilità di scambiare opinioni intorno ad un bicchiere di vino sui diversi stili di vita in Italia e in Grecia.
1272844,20538529,2014-09-30,1920818,Nacho,"Our boat was late but Katerina had arranged for a friend to wait for us and give us the key and show us the room, which helped a lot. We met her the next day and she was great giving us some tips and inviting us to coffee.

The room has everything you need for a short stay, refrigerator, small kitchenette, and a funny shower inside the bathroom.

It is five minutes away from two of the must-see monuments in Athens and 15 minutes walking to the Acrópolis. The location is one of the best things, quiet but close to the city center and with nice bars and restaurants in the neighbourhood.

I would recommend staying here."
1272844,20654391,2014-10-03,20725895,Jurgen,"Zeer vriendelijke en snelle reactie, mooi lokatie in een rustige buurt met alle belangrijke zaken op loopafstand."

The appartment is really special (in a good way) - it's like a smallsmall house. It's quiet and cosy.
Thank you! We would come again!"
1272844,20940084,2014-10-07,169137,Fabio,"Katerina was really welcoming and careful.

The neighborhood (Mets) is nice and safe, with shops, cafés and restaurants quite close.
I truly enjoyed my stay.

1272844,21078423,2014-10-11,13602640,Judith,"Katerina was a great host she gave us great directions and help and even offered to help us with our laundry.
The neighborhood was great and space very central to walking around city.
While the space was very small it was usable for resting at night. "

1272844,22102600,2014-10-30,4545267,Susan,"I had a very nice stay here in this charming area & sweet little studio in Katerina's pretty garden. It was perfect for what I needed- quiet, clean, has a kettle, fridge & little ring burner if you want a simple meal. I slept like a log in the double bed, and as it was late October Katerina made sure there were plenty of blankets & an extra heater in case I got cold.

She helped me with ideas of things to do, places to eat & directions, and seems a wealth of information! Katerina was very nice & friendly but also gave me my privacy-- a great balance.

From the studio it is only a 15 minute walk to so many sights, and I found my way around no problem.

Just be aware that the bathroom (where the only sink is) is small & more like a wetroom as the shower is *in* it.

I really enjoyed staying here in a real Athens neighbourhood, and if you are looking for a quiet, private but not expensive place to stay in a lovely leafy green area of Athens, do check it out. I found it to be quite charming and Katerina a very good host."

1272844,24205971,2014-12-22,24747680,Madelaine,Katerina's lovely home could not have been a better choice. The location was easy walking distance to the heart of Athens and the cozy house was perfect for a solo traveler. Even in the winter with a little rain and some cooler Greece weather my stay was wonderful; coming home to Katerina's humble and comfortable room was just what I needed. Thank you!
1272844,30729768,2015-04-26,21151635,Kayla,"Katerina and her daughter were extremely welcoming, offering us lemonade and soup on arrival. The space offered was small but really cozy and was just a lovely place to come back to. The only cons would be that the wifi has a really weak connection from the room and you have to stay outside if you want to get a better connection. Also, the shower probably needs to be better described in the ad as the bathroom is just a wet room with a handheld shower head. Thanks for everything Katerina and thank your daughter for helping us when needed too! :)"
1272844,33134778,2015-05-25,28399467,Katie,Great place. Location was excellent for a quiet neighborhood. Very clean. Katerina's daughter was very helpful and sweet. Loved the stay!
1272844,34347723,2015-06-07,34046319,Mihyun,"It was just amazing to stay at her house! my friend and I was having trouble finding her place because of the bad weatehr when we arrived, so we called her and she spoke to taxi driver for us( we were having a language barrier with taxi driver) so we got to her house without anymore trouble. She welcomed us with homemade lemonade, and told us how and where to go in Athens.  Also, the place we stayin in was cozy and comfortable. bathroom is little small but it was a personal bathrooom just for us. I would love to stay at her house again if  I ever visit Athens in the future!"
1272844,35237169,2015-06-16,33336229,Eva,The accommodation is located in a real urban neighborhood. Katerina was a very friendly and warm hearted host. She made us feel welcome. The cosy room and the terras has been perfect for our stay in athens! Thank you Katrina for the good time!
1272844,36434285,2015-06-28,35271958,Robin Eileen,"We had a great stay at Katerina's place. She was very friendly, easy going and welcoming. The place is small, but since we were out all day it was enough for sleeping. Katerna's place is located in a very nice neighborhood, with nice cafe's and restaurants. It is very central in Athens, walking distance to most interesting places like Akropolis. We can definitely recommend to stay with Katerina.
Best regards,
Robin and Panos"
1272844,36706994,2015-06-30,19105438,Nadine,"Katerina's apartment is located in an urban, but peaceful neighborhood, in comfortable walking distance from the centre. Our room was clean and very cozy. I also really liked the interior: wooden furniture with a lot of character and some whimsical decorative details strewn in.

We were greeted by a friend of Katerina's, which worked perfectly. He was charming and very helpful, recommending a great place for dinner. Katerina, who we met the following day, was just as warm and welcoming, providing us with lemonade, coffee and more tips. I'd love to stay here again when in Athens."
1272844,36982086,2015-07-03,35399571,Arsh,Small cozy apartment in a very central and local area. Host was a great help in arranging airport transfers and exploring the area
5246919,29586322,2015-04-09,13990433,Olga,"Le logement est plutôt un joli studio qu'une chambre indépendante, Il y a une cuisine séparée et une salle de bains. On a pu profiter d'une vue imprenable sur Athènes et l'Acropole. Souzana et son mari ont été des excellents hôtes. On a pu discuter pas mal des choses et ils nous ont partagé leur connaissance de l'histoire grecque et plein conseils sur la ville. C'est un vrai plaisir de pouvoir ainsi découvrir une ville avec des habitants!  On espère les voir de nouveau si on revient à Athènes. C'est notre meilleure expérience sur Airbnb.

The ¨room¨ is more a cozy, private studio with kitchen and bathroom. The view from the terrace is a beautiful scene over Athens, and specifically the Acropolis. We enjoyed discussing with them (specially their knowledge on the history of Greece and some tips from the city) . It is such a pleasure to be able to discover a city with locals! We really hope to see them again in the next trip to Athens. This was our best experience with Airbnb.
"
5246919,32084876,2015-05-13,14650672,Daniel,"By Souzana we had one of our best Airbnb experience. We got our own appartement at the rooftop with a breathtaking view to whole Athen from the sea till the mountains. We could enjoy our breakfast with fresh orange juice while watching at the Acropolis. From Souzana and her husband we got nice and helpful tipps, what to see, where to eat and also some interesting history details of the sites. We definetely recommend her place to everybody!"
5246919,35565677,2015-06-20,4633723,Ulf,"Alexis and Souzanna made me feel very welcome - not only with words but also with fruits and even a nice little dinner night on the rooftop. The studio is small, it is essentially just a bedroom, a small kitchenette, and a shower room/toilet. But it has all it needs! It even has two little 'front gardens' outside, the one at the back with absolutely stunning views. The quiet location at the edge of Pangrati is ideal for exploring Athens. It's even more ideal if you happen to do a language course at the Athens Centre, which is located just across the road. Ευχαριστω S&A!"
5246919,35932965,2015-06-23,32965441,Steven,"I was welcomed by Alexis, the husband, and he showed me the unit and where everything was. Alexis took the time to walk me down to the area where all the eatery's and cafe's were and the market for incidentals. The neighbor hood was a typical residential area and the loft was situated on the roof top of a 3 story apartment building, walking distance to the acropolis and museums."
5246919,36810260,2015-07-01,34300293,Choon Fu,We received a warm welcome from Suzan's husband when we arrived. The place is awesome as we got the perfect view of Acropolis and great sunset! The place is also close to stadium and local mini market! It is situated at hill side but you can take a taxi to go up to the flat!
1050677,5221002,2013-06-18,5031230,Peter,"Lydia's apartment was very cosy, perfect for a couple, walking distance from Acropoli.We planned to spend one night there but Lydia was so warm-hearted and kind that the way back we changed our mind and spent another night at her flat. So if you are looking for a comfy accommodation and a nice host in Athens you  have already found your place. "
1050677,6371068,2013-08-10,4760265,Vincent,"Lydia welcomed me with a lot of attentions, fruits , Sweet wine And everything was ready in thé kitchenette for my next breakfasts. Thé appartement is very Clean And brand New. She fixes an internet connection to make my stay more connecteded was highly appreciated.  Some days after she délivered an homemde moussaka.
At departure she booked me a taxi to the airport
Unbeatable for this price in Athens.

1050677,7571761,2013-09-24,6679800,Noée,"We had a wonderful Time in Lydia's place. She has been a wonderful host very flexible and welcoming with us. Her place is very convenient (clean, everything you need for cooking is there, comfortable bed, nice terrasse and quiet) and well located (nearby métro station, 15' walk from Syntagma, 20' from acropolis, safe area). We truely recommand her place.
No&Clem"
1050677,8105005,2013-10-15,5965861,Richard,"Lydia's was perfect for us, the kitchen was very well equipped and the whole apartment was spotlessly clean and new, with a lovely verandah. Great value, handy to shops and metro. Even stocked with some food and the best shampoo towels soap etc we've seen in 10 weeks of travel.  "
1050677,8436692,2013-10-30,9412153,Amanda,"Lydia met us at the metro station which was just great! The apartment is spacious and comfortable. Just two metro stops away from the Acropolis and the neighborhood is nice, the metro is just a few minutes walk away. Lydia had wine, snacks and food for breakfast the next day for us! The terrace is just lovely! When we come back to Athens, we will be staying there again! Thank you Lydia! "
1050677,8715713,2013-11-13,9131819,Andreas,My stay at Lydia's place couldn't have been more conveniant. The apartement is very central (15 min on foot to Acropolis) and very well equipped. The balancony is great and huge by the way. Lydia picked me up at the metro station and explained everything to me. In conclusion: nothing more to ask for!
1050677,9763703,2014-01-08,10733270,Regina,"Lydias apartment is small but very convenient for 2 persons and very well equipped with everything you need. She is a very attentive and helpful host. As I arrived on a holiday she had even filled the refrigerator with everything I needed for a good breakfast the next day. The location is good, close to the metro which takes you to the center in 10 minutes or you can walk. And the price is just unbeatable. I can definitely recommend this option and would anytime choose it myself again. "
1050677,11667472,2014-04-11,12049522,Thalia,"Lydia has been an excellent host. She was very prompt with her replies right from when I was first looking to book and gave all the information we needed. The apartment is fully equipped and perfect for people on a working holiday that look for more than just a place to sleep at night, since you can prepare meals and do pretty much anything you would do in your own home. It is  very close to all the sites but still in a typical Athens neighborhood, giving you an idea of how the Athenians live. If the weather permits, you will probably end up spending most of your time on the big balcony. Almost as big as the apartment itself :)
Lydia has been a great resource! She provided us with maps and details about the area, offered to show us around and take us for coffee, provided snacks and breakfast / coffee items. She even met us at the train station and carried our bags for us! Even after we left her apartment she kept giving information and helping us in every way she could. It is obvious that she takes pride in her apartment and takes care of it with love.
As a side note, if you have heard any horror stories about Athens taxi drivers be not afraid! Lydia hooked us up with a great driver who was always ready to help, extremely polite and helpful and with a great knowledge of the city.
This is a place I would happily revisit and recommend to my friends."
1050677,12473715,2014-05-03,5623865,Pauline,"We spent two days in Athens in the Lydia’s apartment. The flat is very nice, exactly as it appears in the pictures. It is quite small but very comfortable with a lovely balcony. The apartment is very well located (15min from Acropolis, use the Pitheous street which is very convenient for walking toward the Parthenonas) and the neighborhood is very calm. You will find everything you need to cook in the apartment.

We have been very happy to meet Lydia who has been very useful : our stay was pleasant and comfortable. We definitely recommend this apartment for people willing to spend some days in Athens!
"
1050677,12587536,2014-05-05,14804361,Emma,"This was truly one of the best value for money stays I have ever rented! Everything was perfect with the apartment . Close to the city,clean ,new and had everything from washing powder supplied to hair product in the bathroom! Lydia was unbelievably accommodating ,even waking to come sit out our apartment at 5am in the morning to ensure our cab she arranged for us arrived to go to the port. This was so lovely . Truly made our stay in athens great. I would totally recommend lydias apartment . "
1050677,13040644,2014-05-18,14245287,Liam,"We had a lovely stay in Athens, Lydia's apartment is even nicer than it looks in the pictures. It had all the essentials you'd need for a short stay and the veranda was a great place to have breakfast. The location is great too, a really quiet safe area (even at night) but only about 15-20 minutes walk to Syntagma Square and only 4 or 5 minutes from Aghios Ioannis metro station. Lydia was a wonderful hostess, she met us at the metro station when we arrived and answered all our questions about the city. She also left us enough food for the next day's breakfast and a bottle of local wine, which I thought was a nice touch. Our flight home was very late but Lydia was very accommodating about us leaving the apartment later and she even stored our luggage for us. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone - nice apartment, convenient location, lovely hostess and fantastic price!"
1050677,13315037,2014-05-25,14313676,Danielle,"My friend and I had such an amazing stay here! The apartment couldn't have been in a better location, it was near all the main tourist attractions, metros, buses and trams. Lydia was sooo lovely! She met me at the metro and showed me to the apartment and made sure I was OK. She had maps there ready for me and made me feel very welcome! She even stocked up the fridge so that we had the basics and didn't need to rush out to get something once we had arrived.

The apartment itself was perfect, exactly what we needed with all the cooking facilities, a really comfy bed, a cute bathroom and a really lovely balcony with furniture.

Lydia also stored our luggage in a separate room on the day we were leaving so that we didn't have to carry it around Athens, she then met us again so that we could collect it.

If I was to return to Athens I would definitely be staying here again.

Thank you so much Lydia. :)"
1050677,13378049,2014-05-26,13544530,Sarah,"Lydia was wonderful and the apartment was adorable!  Lydia accommodated our early arrival, stored our luggage while we were wandering around the city and gave us all the advice we could ask for how we could spend our short time in the city.  She practically walked us all the way to our first destination!  We were also greeted with a bottle of wine which we enjoyed on the balcony after a long day.  The apartment was impeccably clean and I highly recommend it - I hope I have the opportunity to spend more time there sometime soon.  "
1050677,13447724,2014-05-27,14946692,Lily,"Lydia was a wonderful host and made sure we had everything we need to feel comfortable during our stay.
The apartment itself was very well located close to the subway to get anywhere in the city.  The place was small and cozy but just what we needed for a couple nights in Athens. I would highly recommend this place to any travelers passing through."
1050677,13806030,2014-06-04,6105339,Elke,"This is a really nice studio not far from the Acropolis and the main sights! Everything we needed was there, and it was super clean. Lydia is very sweet, gave us some great tips, and she even left us croissants and Retsina in the fridge. The balcony was lovely too, and the neighbourhood was a great escape from touristy crowds. I highly recommend!"
1050677,13978412,2014-06-09,6977942,Michelle,"Lydia's studio is perfect! The location is in the central part of Athens, within walking distance of the major historical areas. There is a metro stop a few blocks away and it is just 3 stops away from the Acropolis area and 4 stops away from the transfer to airport.

The space is small but very nice and clean with all amenities. There is coffee pot, cooktop, cookware, dishware, a washing machine as well basic food items, coffee, tea, sugar, oil for cooking, etc...Lydia provided extra linens and towels. Also, there is TV, free WiFi, and air conditioning. The studio has a large balcony that is nice for relaxing.

Lydia was very helpful and met me at the apartment to show me how everything works. She provided maps and very helpful advice on how to get around Athens. Also, Lydia let me store my luggage on checkout day since I had a very late flight out of Athens. Overall,  I had a wonderful stay in Athens thanks to Lydia! Highly recommended."
1050677,14160324,2014-06-13,13591953,Hayley,Just like the pictures.  Had a great but very quick stay.  Thx Lydia.
1050677,14472593,2014-06-20,15004289,Dimi,"Lydia was a good host. She picked my friend and i up from Metro train station as planned, walked us to the apartment, provided us with maps, recommendations for sight seeing, eating etc. The apartment was exactly as pictured, very clean and the balcony was very spacious.  Lydia was contactable by phone if we needed anything but she gave good info from the start so we didn't need to contact her.
The apartment is very good value for the location.  The only suggestion my friend would make is for a shower screen to be added as it is difficult to shower without the water going everywhere."
1050677,14714906,2014-06-24,16732416,John,"Many thanks Lydia, we really enjoyed our stay in your apartment, the space was perfect for our needs and had everything we needed. the balcony was also great for dinner in the evenings. if you are visiting Athens this is a great central place to stay, very quite and safe neighbourhood, 15 minutes walk to Athens sights, also near metro stop which was an 7 minute walk, could not recommend this apartment enough."
1050677,14822129,2014-06-27,1801280,James,"Lydia was very helpful during our stay in her apartment. She met us at the closest subway station, guided my girlfriend and I to her apartment and gave us an introduction to Athens neighbourhoods with a map. Having stayed in many Airbnb apartments over the last year in many cities, Lydia's was absolutely spotless, included towels, wifi, and even a little snack for breakfast and was nicely located 20-25 min walk to the Parthenon. I would definitely recommend Lydia's cozy apartment to anyone. "
1050677,14888902,2014-06-28,8324240,Valentin,"Lydia is a wonderful person and a great host! She has sent a taxi driver to meet us in the airport and us in a very early arrival hour at the apartment, got us some coffee and kept our things stored till the check-in time (and after check-out till the flight). She has also shown us the area and recommended great places to visit. The apartment is small and cozy - perfect for single or couple. Everything was clean and there was more then enough for good vacation stay. The location is very comfortable to visit all the historic spots and explore the old city center. It's just about 10-15 minutes walk from the Akropoli. Would recommend it definitely for a good stay in Athens."
1050677,14985773,2014-06-30,4695910,Fiona,"Lydia met us at the station and was really flexible about our check in time. She was very friendly and had lots of information about Athens. The place itself was small but clean and perfectly suited to 1-2 person's needs. The balcony is a nice place to chill and eat dinner (the kitchen is fully equipped) and Lydia was able to arrange a nice taxi driver to take us to the port. Thanks Lydia, we really enjoyed Athens!"

1050677,15331992,2014-07-07,2853689,Andres,"Lydia’s apartment was the perfect choice for a 3-day visit to Athens like ours. It has a very good location, very close to a metro station (no more than a 5 minutes walk), to supermarkets, bakeries and grocery stores. If you enjoy walking, you will be able to reach by foot the Acropolis, Temple of Zeus, Panathenaic Stadium and Syntagma Sq. We were short of time, so we took the metro to other locations. The apartment is small, but it is good equipped. It has a very good A/C for those hot summer days in Athens.

Lydia is a great host. She met us at metro station and gave us a lot of good advices about the city. She even helped us to coordinate a taxi for airport transfer."
1050677,15847727,2014-07-16,17763639,Marne,"What a gem! This was a perfect fit for our quick trip to Athens. We had an action packed schedule and Lydia's clean, beautiful apartment was the peaceful oasis amidst the city's bustle. She was incredibly helpful and kind from the moment we booked till we said our goodbyes. The apartment is clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated. The area has all that one would need - good bakeries, good grocery stores and a great fruit stand right on the corner. She is very close to the subway stop, but also within walking distance of the Acropolis and Plaka. We would definitely return and can highly recommend it to others. "

Удобное расположение относительно общественного транспорта, рядом метро ΑΓ.ΙΩΑΝΝΗΣ которое идёт в одну сторону до Акрополя или в другую в сторону пляжа, также очень удобно добираться с аэропорта. Лидия встретила нас сразу у метро и проводила до квартиры попутно указав где и что. Напротив метро находится маленькая кофейня где подают самый вкусный фредо еспрессо/капучино в Афинах :) В соседнем доме, в 50 шагах фруктовый магазинчик, пекарня с домашним хлебом и печеньками, два супермаркета, множество кафе и забегаловок. Квартира рекомендуется для проведения каникул в прекрасных Афинах на 100%!!! Лидия доброжелательная хозяйка квартиры всегда готова ответить на все вопросы и помочь!"

Washmachine and all you need for this, like detergent, iron and trouser.

A kitchen with several condiments, oil y vinegar for preparing some dishes, sugar and avoiding to buy things you won't need much.

She also provided some sewing kit in case we have any clothes emergency!

But over all, Lydia was very kind with us and explaned all we need know to move us in the city. She told us where to buy, where to go, how to manage ourself with diferent tourist office's...Lydia has a great heart.

And if this all is not enough, she has always provide us some food and wine that we could always grab from the kitchen.
Thanks so much Lydia!"

""The accommodation"" has everything you need in a cosy fashion with a big balcony to enjoy your breakfast and coffee or tea.

""And Lydia"" is the best host I ever met. She gave us a map with information about the area and many good advices. She made us feel very welcome during our stay — Thank you Lydia!

Her apartment is perfect, it's immaculate, all appliances work very well and the air conditioner is a life saver on the hot nights. It even has a nice little outside area with chairs and a table which was lovely. There are shops and restaurants nearby so it's in a prime location, and at an affordable price. I can definitely recommend Lydia's apartment to anyone else looking to spend some time in Athens!"

Its 20 minutes from the Acropole by walking and Lydia took really care of us, explaining what we could visit and  offering her help if we needed. We warmly recommand this place ! :)"
1050677,18990931,2014-09-04,18103142,Kateřina,"Pěkný malý byt, který přesně odpovídá fotografiím. Skvělý balkon. Klimatizace a wifi funguje. Okolí klidné, 20 minut pěšky od Akropolis. Supermarket poblíž. Lydia přesná a pečlivá, vždy ochotná poradit. Maximálně doporučuji."
1050677,19218146,2014-09-08,19479932,Kelvin,"We stayed at Lydia's for 3 nights and she was a great host. Our luggages were misplaced by the airline the day we arrived Athens and Lydia made so much effort to help us get them back the next day. The apartment is in a quiet area, which we liked. Everything was clean and tidy inside. It has everything you need, from clean towels to wine glasses. We had a very enjoyable stay in Athens."
1050677,19881865,2014-09-20,19902540,Sarah,"This was my first time using AirBNB and it was a great experience. Lydia gave me instructions on which metro station to meet her at from the airport. Our flight landed late so we were an hour late meeting her there but she waited anyway and walked us to her apartment. I was so grateful for this after an exhausting day of travel. The apartment was as described- very clean and charming. It was small but had everything we needed. Lydia even put a bottle of water in the fridge for us so it was cold when we arrived, and stocked the fridge with some fruit, beer, and milk for the coffee. There was coffee and tea available and an easy to use drip coffee pot. Lydia had provided her fine glassware and encouraged us to use it. She reviewed everything in the apartment (the AC, water heater, washing machine, etc), and gave us recommendations on restaurants, main roads to get the the tourist attractions, etc. She checked on us the next day to make sure we were okay and helped us set up a taxi service for our return home since our flight was very early. The apartment was an easy walk to the acropolis (15 minutes). I would not say the apartment was in the most glamorous part of town, the entrance to her apartment is at a small dark street but I never felt unsafe. The building was very secure and locked both at the entrance and the individual apartment. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The only negative was there was not much space to put your suitcases and clothing so we ended up laying a lot of stuff on the couch. "
1050677,20912356,2014-10-07,8062811,Frédéric,"Lovely appartment well equipped. The appartment's very clean and looks brand new. Good location as well, just a few minutes from Acropolis by public transport. Lydia's nice and helpful. Will recommand this place to other travellers! "

She did a great job helping us to get to know the area and even left us maps which helped us get to the acropolis. I would definitely book with Lydia again and recommend anyone visiting in the Athens area to do so also! ευχαριστώ Lydia!
1050677,22315378,2014-11-03,6197971,Salome,"The studio was very clean, it was small but it had absolutely everything what would you need for few days. It had a nice balcony. Thanks Lydia, that you thought about many many details how to make your guests'  stay more interesting and comfortable. "
1050677,22546228,2014-11-09,4355849,Corina,"Lydia was the perfect host and gave great suggestions of things to do in Athens - thank you Lydia!

The flat is great - a studio flat but definitely enough space for two people, especially with the nice balcony it has. The location is perfect - 20 mins walk to the Acropolis and it is located in a quiet neighborhood. Very clean and homely too. I would definitely stay here again!"
1050677,23047481,2014-11-21,17664296,Nicholas,Lydia was a Great host she met us at the Metro station and walked us up to the flat. (which was located very close.) She had everything we could of needed already she spent time making sure we understood the area. Mainly we walked to the centre which if you're like my Wife and I walk to see new things rather than tai the metro. Anyway her neighbourhood was filled with restaurant and food. The flat size is small but just so for my wife me and our one year old we didn't need anymore space. Would recommend.
1050677,23980158,2014-12-15,22573652,Mahnaz,That's for everything was lovely staying in your flat
1050677,24756495,2015-01-02,24369671,Lefteris,"The apartment was exactly what we were looking for; clean,cosy and very close to the center of Athens. Last but not least, Lydia has amazed us with her hospitality and kindness. Thanks a lot for everything!"
1050677,25558722,2015-01-19,24160868,Rastko,"The appartment is in a quiet street. Very clean and looks brand new.
Perfectly equiped and close to Acropolis and other historic sites.
I would recommend Lydia's place to anyone. "

1050677,28966599,2015-04-01,22644114,Tom,"We had an wonderful time at Lydias apartment. She picked us up from the train station and showed us the way to the apartment. There she draw us a perfect map and explained us everything. We felt so welcome. We had internet a tv  and all we needed to cook and feel like home. We would like to come back soon and recommend that lovely place to  everybody.
Love Janet & Tom"

The apartment was clean and stocked with basic needs such as wine and shampoo! The morning I left Lydia walked me to the train station and gave me chocolate croissants for breakfast. I would definitely stay again next time I'm in Athens. Thank you sooooooo much Lydia."

"
1050677,31514829,2015-05-06,10443493,Camille,"Lydia was very welcoming, she had prepared a city map with the things to see, to do. The apartment is very comfortable, clean and well located, about 15 minute walk from the Acropolis. We would stay again, I recommand Lydia's place !"
1050677,31907976,2015-05-11,24793186,Vladislav,"I booked this appartment for my mother and her friend so I'm writing this review behalf of them.
This nice appartment was a big reason of their excellent trip to Athens. Lydia was very kind to help them make their stay unfortable.
The apartments are perfect for two people, that also has a very nice place to have a rest with a glass of wine, a terrace.
They were very grateful to Lydia for some souvenirs and for everything that made their stay unforgetful.
The location is perfect, near the centre of the city with a nice neighbourhood.
Looking forward to visit this place by myself one day :)"
1050677,32075288,2015-05-13,19843984,Brittany,"Lydia was a fantastic host, she most certainly went out of her way to make sure I was accommodated. She even went as far as to meet me at the station the day I arrived and walk me back (at 5:30 in the morning!) the day I left. She was beyond nice and very, very helpful. She had a pre-printed map already ready when I got there and gave me a mini tour of Greece while she was at it. Definitely would recommend this apartment!  "
1050677,32521872,2015-05-19,18065656,Daniel,"Lydia was very nice and helpful. The first day i arrived she waited for me in the metro station, my flight arrived at athens late and she waited until i arrived to guide me to the apartment. The apartment is very neat and cozy. Looks exactly how the pictures describe it. Very nice apartment and extremely clean. I wouldn't doubt going back, its a 10 minute walk to the acropolis, panathenaic stadium, and cheap but good restaurants. Amazing experience. "
1050677,33010404,2015-05-24,13070337,Rosa,"My husband and I spent two nights in Lydia's apartment during our recent visit to Greece. Lydia was extremely helpful from the start. She responded to emails promptly and gave us proper directions to get to the metro stop. She was at the metro stop to receive us even though we arrived late in the night and half an hour later than the scheduled time. She took us to a place to get dinner and once we were in the flat gave us an overview of the places we could visit and provided us with a map of the city.

The flat itself was well-equipped and had everything from a washing machine to a hairdryer. The bathroom didn't have a shower-curtain but its just something we are used to but was missing there. The apartment is perfect for a couple, it has a nice balcony and is at walking distance from the Acropolis and other places of interest. There are also some nice cafes and eating joints close by. Lydia had also left some chocolates, chips and beer for us to enjoy which made us feel welcome.

On the day of our departure, since we had an early flight to catch, Lydia arranged for a taxi and even came personally to see us off at 04:15 in the morning!!! Lydia has been the perfect hostess and she went out of her way to make our stay in Athens a comfortable one."
1050677,33450939,2015-05-28,31896815,Carole,"Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Lydia qui est vraiment très gentille et aux petits soins! Elle nous a donné toutes les indications necessaire au bon déroulement de notre séjour
L'appartement est tel que décrit très propre et avec tout ce qu'il faut (lave linge, climatisation...)
Très bonne localisation à environ 20 minutes à pied du centre d'Athènes, il y a tout ce qu'il faut à proximité (boulangerie supermarché...)
Nous recommandons fortement ce logement pour un séjour à Athènes
Merci encore à Lydia"
1050677,34068878,2015-06-04,3457386,Bo,"I spent 3 nights in Lydia's flat a solo traveller and I had an excellent time! She was waiting for me at the metro station and gave me an extensive introduction to the area, and explained how to get to the main sights - turns out the location is perfect, it didn't take long to walk to Acropolis (approx. 15 mins), but the metro is only 5 minutes away if you don't fancy walking. The flat is very clean, smells nice and Lydia made sure that I had everything I needed..including an iron, sewing kit, olive oil for cooking, etc. I enjoyed having breakfast on the balcony, and the street was quiet and safe! I highly recommend everyone to book this place, you can't get a better value for your money!"
1050677,34628922,2015-06-10,30186798,Kimberly,"My boyfriend and I spent nearly a week at Lydia's apartment. It is pretty close to the main attractions, about 20 minutes by foot. Lydia was quick at replying enquires and gave proper directions to take the metro. She was even there to pick us up from the station, although our flight was slightly delayed and brought us to the apartment. The place itself is clean and self-sufficient and the balcony is perfect to relax in the daytime. On the day of our departure, her friend Fenia helped us booked a taxi and was there to send us off. Overall, the apartment was value for money."
1050677,34966438,2015-06-14,29340709,Kahmun,"The experience in Athens was amazing especially with such a kind hostess like Lydia! My boyfriend and I enjoyed ourselves very much. What we appreciated most was her warm welcome with briefings of the Athens map and her warnings of pickpockets in crrtain areas of Greece. Her apartment was clean and looked really inviting when we arrived. She even prepared beer for us and had almost all essentials (hairdryers, EU adapters, etc). "
1050677,35326832,2015-06-17,34419771,Кирилл,"We are so glad that we find Lydia. She is so kind person. It seemed like we knew each other so long. The apartment is very comfortable. We were there with a small kid. And it was clean and safe  for him. It is close to everything interesting in Athens, so we could go everywhere on foot. We spent in Athens just a few days but thanks Lydia everything was perfect. We left happy and even with some gifts from her. Thank you, Lydia, one more time! We love you"
1050677,35670076,2015-06-21,8951636,Sebastian,"Lydia was really nice host. She picked up us from metro station also went there with us on the day we left. Lydia showed us neighborhood, showed on map what to visit, where to go, where not go ;), was really helpful during our stay.
Apartment like in description, cosy, clean, you got there everything you need and also have great terrace, where you can have morning coffee or rest after a long day of sightseeing. Location absolutely perfect, close to metro station, quiet area and 15 minutes walk to Acropolis. To sum up in one word: great Airbnb experience. We can highly recommend Lydia and her place. "
1050677,36026251,2015-06-24,33565298,Kelly,Lydia is so nice that she came to the metro station to bring us to the apartment. She also went to the metro station with us on the day we left which is so warm and lovely. The apartment is really comfortable and beautiful! Lydia also gave us a map of athens and taught us the way for going to different attractions. We love this place and Lydia so much and would definitely stay here again if we visit athens next time!
1050677,36386171,2015-06-28,23020532,Felix Eduardo,"No tenemos palabras para describir la amabilidad de Lydia , todo lo que está en la página es correcto , pero más allá de esto , la responsabilidad , puntualidad , educación , y la tolerancia hacia mis preguntas , la excelente explicación  sobre como , por donde , moverse , a pie , en metro , y en tram fue excelente y donde comer , y comprar . La experiencia fue maravillosa , y por último nos vino a despedir a las 6 hs con un taxi que nos llevó al puerto para nuestro viaje"
1050677,36891952,2015-07-02,24658169,Russell,"Lydia was simply awesome. She's like a mother caring for her children and making sure everything is in order. Our ferry on the day we depart was in the morning 7am and she came down to the apartment at 6am to make sure we are awake and on time for it. Too lovely. The apartment likewise. It's very comfortable and well equipped for a studio apartment. The balcony is very spacious and relaxing to chill. All sightseeings are very conveniently accessible by foot or transport. Overall, perfect. "
1050677,37197585,2015-07-05,35131898,Jaap,"Lydia was waiting for us at the metrostation nearby the appartment and she walked us to the accomodation. There she explained everything in detail and showed us the nice places in Athens on a map. There were wifi, kitchenfacilities, a clean bathroom and we were very happy with the washing machine! We had a really pleasant stay. The price per night was very fair and I would recommend this place to all who read this. "
1050677,38163668,2015-07-13,11182361,Zsófia,"It was a pleasure to spend 2 nights at Lydia's cosy and brand new flat. The neigbourhood was perfect also every monuments and shops, cafe places and restaurants are closed. "
2423058,11192822,2014-03-24,1910518,Alexis,"That was a fantastic experience, a bit out of the ordinary, and quite enchanting. Maja and her sis Manuela are great hosts, the communication was easy and they were very careful I don't get lost, the night of my arrival - even if that was quite late.

It really is a little cabana, in a residential part of town, uphill behind the Stadium.
The neighbourhood is cool, out of the tourist-beaten tracks, with a few coffees and restaus worth having a try. Ermou St. and Syntagma  Sq. are only a few bus stops  (bus 209) or tram stops (Tram 11) away, or about 20 minutes by foot. The whole place has its distinctive bohemian feeling - the courtyard is great (complete with stray cats, and tree shades); don't expect modern and sanitized comfort there - even if all is very clean and functional. Picture rather a summer house in the country (barking dogs sometime at nigth or nearby busy basketball field might bring you back to the city though...). One has to wrestle a bit in the bathroom, but the water is hot, and it all does work fine. I loved the study too , and internet comes handy, with a fast and reliable connection. A place certainly better fitted for summer and sunny days than for winter time, as most urban appartments in Athens - and March evenings were a bit coldish.   But all considered, a great place.  "
2423058,11412896,2014-04-01,13115883,Sam,The hosts were excellent and very communicative and very helpful. The house is very pretty and perfect for a stay in Athens - just a short walk from all the main attractions. Very much recommended.
2423058,11939003,2014-04-19,1483661,Kristen,"There are some places that strike you immediately and make you immensely happy, and Maja and Manuela's cottage is one of them. I stayed here for a few nights during the Easter season, and I wish that I had booked for a month. The neighborhood is very special. I greatly enjoyed the numerous cafes, bakeries, and artists' and iconographers' workshops, and traveling to Plaka or the big museums is very easy. As for the space, it is magical. Quiet. Green. Simple. There's a good collection of books and the kitchen is well-stocked. As a grad student, I found their home a haven. Two desks and two beds and a garden-- why did I leave?? Manuela had the radio set on Flash 96 when I arrived, and that's where it stayed-- opera and jazz floating through the bright blue windows. If you are searching for a tranquil place nestled in the middle of an amazing city, you've found it. You will not find more pleasant and helpful hostesses. I will certainly be returning with my sister soon to visit with Manuela and Maja again."
2423058,12132844,2014-04-23,1200937,Jen,"Maja's house was a great place to stay in Athens. She was easy to communicate with in planning our trip, and her sister was there to meet us when we arrived. Our taxi driver was certain we were at the wrong address as it is a metal gate in a graffiti-covered wall that didn't look too inviting. However, he checked it out for us, and it was indeed the right place. Once inside, the house is unique and adorable. Don't expect luxury accommodation, but it is comfortable and clean and in a safe, non-touristy neighborhood with cute local cafes and bakeries. There are bus and tram options nearby, but it is also an easy walk to Syntagma Square. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others."
2423058,12343108,2014-04-29,1752472,Katie,This was such a cute place and really made you feel like you were on an island in the middle of Athens. It was close to everything. It was only 15-20 minutes walking to everything! And the team was about 5 minutes away walking. Maja's sister Manuela was super nice and very helpful! Overall it was a great experience.
2423058,12504854,2014-05-04,2276499,Christine,"The neighbourhood you stay in is great, in fact  - an amazing location for Athens - and Maja and her sister, who both take care of the place are lovely people. The apartment is in fact some sort of hut-complex where each room is a unit in itself, all connected by a private courtyard that is roofed by big green leaves. It is enchanting in a dreamy way, an ode to simple life and everlasting hippy spirit - it is for sure mostly a place to stay in summer, as you exit to the patio before entering the bathroom. And everything has a ""trick"", the lights, the boiler, the shower, the flush... and they are to be followed up on, ie, switch off the boiler after heating up before having a shower... It seems electric curcuits etc have been adapted to the evolving needs of the place by artists;) We liked it and had no problems whatsoever, but it s sure more hippy than hipster;)  "
2423058,12911205,2014-05-13,13630257,Erica,We loved this cute little place! We did not meet Maja but her sister Manuela was very helpful and we had a great time. Not in a super touristy area but still walking distance to all the sights.
2423058,13142421,2014-05-20,13604091,Patrick,"Tres bon accueil, maison sympa et reposante. L'acces au centre d Athenes peut même se faire a pied. Attention a ne pas rater l'entrée (porte  en fer bleue)  équipements rustiques.
Brigitte et Patrick"
2423058,13223651,2014-05-22,9164063,Robert,"The accommodation is located in a really calm area if athens. Public transport and sightseeing points are really close by. Maja is a very friendly and helpful host. It was easy to communicate with her! I really recommend the ""traditionelles inselhaus"""
2423058,13506552,2014-05-29,11038245,Simone,"Bei Maja war es absolut perfekt. Das Haus ist wunderschön versteckt mit einem kühlen schattigen Garten. Man ist sehr schnell auf dem Fußweg im Zentrum und kann genauso gut in der anderen Richtung lauschige Plätze mit unglaublich netten Cafes und Restaurants finden. Die Umgebung ist großartig, ein bisschen auf einem Hügel gelegen mit Blick über die Stadt, und Maja und ihre Schwester sorgten mit Stadtplänen und Tipps für einen guten Start im riesigen Athen. Übrigens: Beide sprechen auch deutsch. Besser gehts nicht. 100%. Wenn ich das nächste Mal nach Athen komme, dann wieder hierhin.

The house of Maja is perfekt, near by the Akropolis and in the other direction you will find nice places with Restaurants and Bars. Everything per feed and Maja have some maps of Athen and many good Tips. The house ist wonderful, calm, cold and beautyful. 100% and if I come the next time, I will only stay here. "
2423058,13788387,2014-06-04,4820887,David,"I enjoyed the stay in Maja's house, and Manuela's willingness to meet me at a late hour of my arrival. The location was good, as I was seeking something a bit out of the tourist center. There is access to shops and restaurants/cafés in easy walking distance. The space was very charming and comfortable. It's open, so if you're averse to a rustic environment or bugs this may not be your place. The only issue I had with this rental was there was no internet as advertised which was not mentioned during my check in process. I inquired via multiple emails about the access, but didn't receive a response until the day of my departure. Other than that my stay was quite pleasant."
2423058,13877166,2014-06-07,10762155,Olivia,très bon endroit . Atypique et beaucoup de charme. A 20 minutes à pieds de la station de métro centrale. Quartier sympa . Simplicité et calme
2423058,14083550,2014-06-11,2794101,Igor,Maja and her sister are good hosts. We had  beautiful days in Athens. Amazing house in the center of  Athens has island style. We felt   inside like in village. It was very simple to reach to the Parthenon and the central square of Athens on foot. . Many thanks for hospitality. I will try to return to this house  in autumn when   grapes will hang in the yard.
2423058,14506424,2014-06-21,13446376,Daniela,Maja and her sister are great hosts! They were always nice and friendly and offered help during our stay. The house is great and really unique. It definitely added a very special flair to our trip. I can recommend the house and Maja as host to everyone going to Athens!
2423058,14736392,2014-06-25,14153818,Glenda,"Thank you Maja and Manuela for a great stay in Athens! You were so welcoming, friendly and helpful, going out of your way to assist. Your place was clean and neat and a peaceful escape from the city's bustle.
"
2423058,15395533,2014-07-08,3500074,Kiki,The house is really cute and gives you the feeling you are a hippie on the country side. The small indoor garden is perfect if you want to escape the heat and the rush of the city. Maja and her sister took really good care of us. The communication was good and they provided loads of ideas to spend your time in Athens.
2423058,15487194,2014-07-10,12846827,Caitlin,"We stayed for two nights, one night apart, at Maja's place. She and her sister were very helpful and accommodating, letting us leave our luggage there on the night in between. The house is very unique, and we enjoyed the experience. There are two completely separate rooms across the courtyard from each other so my friend and I felt like we had our own space. Travelers should be aware that it is definitely rustic! You can leave all the doors open to the courtyard, it's very secure, but dirt and bugs do get in.

The location was perfect, a 15 minute walk away from the Acropolis museum and the bustling Plaka area. It's up on a hill in a residential neighborhood, so it's quiet at night but can be a trek with luggage."
2423058,15791685,2014-07-15,15265323,Margot,"What a whimsical place this was! Coming home to the private courtyard was so lovely after a day in the bustle of the city. Each room had its own unique character, and I loved that the place was stocked with books, music, and movies.

Do note if you wish to stay here that, as others have said, you cant  expect a luxury accommodation. But if you don't mind an older place (with a lot of character) then this place is perfect! Expect a few bugs at night though!"
2423058,16291101,2014-07-25,13453639,Rose,"Manuella a été accueillante et comprehensive.
L'endroit est charmant mais il a vite perdu tout son charme à cause de petites bêtes (cafards, punaises de lit...) "
2423058,17526130,2014-08-13,17332433,Ha,"I can't imagine having stayed anywhere else! The house was terrific; too bad we got to stay only one night. We didn't meet Maja in person but were welcomed by her sister, Manuela, who was very nice and helped us a lot during our stay. She let us leave our luggages for a day at the house after check-out and even called a taxi to the airport for us. Absolutely wonderful host!

About the house: it was like a oasis in Athens. It was within walking distance to Acropolis and convenience stores, fruit stalls etc. The house is in a residential area and definitely a rare find for its charm and the owners' artsy taste. Don't expect luxury when you come here, but do expect a lot of character. The house might as well top that.

Thanks a lot for a wonderful (albeit short) stay, Maja and Manuela!

"
2423058,18661551,2014-08-30,3145096,Maryse,"Nice ""cabane"" in the center of Athènes. Lot of charm and everything you need here, simple but charming."
2423058,19186894,2014-09-08,7860148,Andres,"I was always in good e-mail contact with Maja, I knew from her that either her sister Manuela or a friend of hers will welcom me. The man was very kind and explain me in details how things work at the house. The house is in a very quite area about 10 minutes walking from Acropoli. Internet works well and house is basic but comfortable. "
2423058,19768822,2014-09-18,13913011,Gilbert,"We stayed 3 nights at Maja's house, everything went well during our stay. Maja was kind and helpful, the house is nice with a lot of character but rustic. The garden is lovely and perfect to spend the evening after a long walk in Athens.  The house is in residential area (The Mets) around 15 mn walk to the acropolis an 20 mn walk to Syntagma."
2423058,20087800,2014-09-23,17656830,Richard,"Everything went as expected,we had a great time."
2423058,20231152,2014-09-26,15624508,Gwen,"Das Haus ist ein Traum! Mitten in der Großstadt so ein kleines Idyll vorzufinden war perfekt direkt nach unserem Aufenthalt auf Naxos. Die Kommunikation mit den Gastgeberinnen ging stets zügig, war unkompliziert und herzlich. Sehr gern haben wir im Hof gesessen und die Atmosphäre genossen (Achtung: Mückenkerze hilfreich!).

Nettes kleines Cafè die Straße runter, betrieben von einem albanischen Paar, das – trotz wenig Englisch – sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit ist bei allerlei Fragen.


The house is a dream! To find such an idyllic small place in the middle of the big city was absolutely perfect after our Naxos-trip. We liked a lot to sit in the lovely patio and enjoyed the atmosphere (mosquito spray can be helpful!).
The communication with the host girls went always quickly, effective and very friendly.

Down the road you find a little café, run by an albanian couple. They speak very few english, but are really friendly and helpful with any questions.
"
2423058,20413806,2014-09-29,12633490,Bruce,"This was a great little spot.  Very central and great ambience, hidden behind a big wall.  Perhaps a little more rustic than the pictures suggest.  We were met at the door and given good tour of the facilities."
2423058,28875464,2015-03-31,9985155,Isabella,"We didn't actually meet Maja—she doesn't live in Athens—but (after a little miscommunication!) her lovely mother let us into the house, and also came to see us off when we left four days later.

We really loved staying there, it truly is an island house in the middle of the city and you almost forget where you are! There is a great square nearby with delicious restaurants and it is easy enough to walk to public transportation.

However, just a word of warning, it might not be for everyone—it is quite rustic! It is a little hard to to tell from the listing, but the house is actually TWO houses: you have to cross the little courtyard to reach the living room and kitchen, while the bedroom and bathroom are a separate structure (though you do have to go outside to enter the bathroom, there is no interior door connecting the two).  Additionally, we happened to be in Athens during a slightly chilly time (around 46*F/8*C) and this house is designed to stay very, very cool; it would probably be much better suited to a summertime vacation."
2423058,29311192,2015-04-06,6418106,Daniela,"Das Inselhaus ist eine zauberhafte Unterkunft. Hinter der unscheinbaren Eingangstür verbirgt sich ein idyllischer, liebevoll dekorierter Hof. Hier kommt nichts vom, drausen tobenden, Großstadtlärm an. Da das Haus auf einem sehr steilen Berg liegt, sollte man auf jeden Fall,  zumindest aber bei der Anreise, wenn man Gepäck dabei hat, ein Taxi nehmen.
Heidi hat mich sehr freundlich empfangen und sie hat mir bei einem Glas Wein gleich die wichtigsten Tipps gegeben. Außerdem haben Maja und Heidi einen sehr nützlichen Stadtplan mit Insider-Infos im Haus.
Das Haus ist einfach aber sehr gemütlich und stilvoll eingerichtet und entspricht 100%ig der Beschreibung. Das Bett war sehr bequem und ich habe sehr gut geschlafen. Die Küche ist mit allem Notwendigen ausgestattet, sofern man nicht vor hat mehrgängige Menüs zuzubereiten.
Die Lage der Wohnung ist wirklich ideal, da man sehr schnell zu Fuß in der Altstadt, Akropolis, am Syntagma- und Monistiraki-Platz ist.
Wenn einem die Athener ""Berge"" zu anstregend werden, kann man aber auch gut mit einigen Trollybussen zur Unterkunft gelangen.
Die Kommunikation mit Heidi war super. Ich habe den Aufenthalt im Inselhaus sehr genossen. Vielen Dank!"

Our stay was beautiful and without any complications. The little house has enough space and the neighbourhood has pretty coffeeplaces, a small streetmarket on fridays and plenty possibilities for grocery shopping. Thanks a lot!"
2423058,29823056,2015-04-13,13071148,Lenneke,"The welcome was warm. Everything about the house has been explained and it was a wonderful place in a wonderful neigbourhood. The house is basic, but that doesn't matter. Everything you need is there and the decoration felt very welcoming. It was very quiet. At the same time you could walk in 10 minutes to the Akropolis. The local restaurant was very good. Altough it was Greek Eastern and officially closed it served a traditional Eastern soup. The next time I would definitely stay here again!!"
2423058,30446075,2015-04-22,2302954,Vova,"We enjoyed our stay. Maja is a terrific host. She does not live in Athens but she was quick to answer all my messagesto her, and her friend Julia met us at the place with all we needed to know. The place itself is really special - it really feels like a little Greek island house in the middle of the city. Like other people wrote, it is rustic, you move between the rooms through the little garden, and the facilities are functional but simple. If you expect a regular city apartment, you might be disappointed, but for us the place had a terrific summerhouse vibe that allowed us to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. Our 1 y/o son also enjoyed running around the garden and finding its hidden treasures.
The neighborhood is lovely. It is relatively close to the center, but allows you to see some more natural sides of Athens, and its full of cafes and restaurant which cater the locals. There is a fantastic street food market every friday just around the corner and grocers, butchers, bakers and so on during the rest of the week. All in all, it was a pleasure."
2423058,30941601,2015-04-29,11534099,Christiane,"Das Inselhaus ist wirklich wie eine Oase. Nicht weit von der Innenstadt und doch total ruhig. Und durch den Innenhof kann auch gemütlich die Zeit zwischen Erkundungstouren draussen verbracht werden. Wir haben unsere Zeit dort sehr genossen.
Maja hat sich sehr gut um uns gekümmert. Der Kontakt war super nett und wir wurden mit allen nötigen Infos für Ankunft, Aufenthalt und Rückfahrt versorgt. Es gibt im Haus viele Stadtpläne und viele tolle Bücher zum schmökern.
Vielen Dank für die Möglichkeit im Inselhaus unterzukommen!"
2423058,31433799,2015-05-05,28407069,Dirk,"Lovely rustic place, good location, not much noise. ..you will have to love back to basics though. ...and i mean basics! :-)...i love snails ...with some garlic butter ...but not on the bathroom floor :-)..lovely patio ,kitchen and bedrooms like u remember from ur great grand mother ....bathroom needs a major renewal though. ..a shed and some of the trickiest electric wiring i have seen in decades.. .all held together with some tape, a hope and a prayer ....nevertheless the place is very atmospheric and romantic !would definitely visit again!"
2423058,31974687,2015-05-12,11872982,Marc,"Even if it means going back to the basics as I have read in others comments, I have been very happy to live in Maja's Traditional island house. We have been welcomed by Maja's friend Julia who had prepared the house and gave us all sort of information about it as well as some tips about nice places and Athens quarters to see. Despite the slugs who stayed in their corner in the bathroom, the place was clean and functional. I really loved to rest in the garden, that is the center of this lovely house, after spending the day visiting Athens, reading a book, listening the bumblebee flying from flower to flower over my head. I also liked being in a neighborhood without all the tourists met during the day in Athens and enjoyed stopping at some cafes to drink a cafe frappe or a Greek coffee :-)
The contact with Maja (via mail) has been very pleasant.
All in all, it was a very nice long week end we spent in Athens and I would come again to Maja's house again with pleasure."
2423058,32174397,2015-05-15,9309424,Emilie,"Nous avons passé un super séjour à Athènes. Merci Maja et Julia pour votre accueil ! Maja a été très disponible avant et pendant notre séjour en Grèce et  a très rapidement répondu à toutes nos questions sur son appartement et sur Athènes ou la Grèce en général. C'est son amie Julia qui nous a accueillis chaleureusement en nous donnant plein d'infos sur la ville. L'appartement est un havre de paix dans Athènes, bien équipé et doté d'une cours intérieure spacieuse et agréable. Il est pratique d'accès pour rejoindre le centre historique en bus, à pied (15min) ou pour revenir en taxi quand il est tard (environ 5 euros depuis le centre). Le quartier est tranquille et vivant (bars, restaurants, supermarché à proximité). Parfait pour nos trois nuits à Athènes après un voyage dans les Cyclades."
2423058,32332182,2015-05-17,7971908,Tara,"The host was really friendly and easy to deal with. She ensured that we're knew where we were going and the easiest way to get there, extremely helpful. She also had great suggestions of where to go in Athens for an authentic experience of the city! The house was absolutely perfect, it was like a beautiful little oasis in the center if Athens. I would definitely book it again if I return! "
2423058,34882811,2015-06-13,16209466,Mariah,"I stayed four nights at Maja's place and it was a lovely retreat from busy Athens. As others have noted, it is rustic-- but it is also charming. Recommended for laid back travelers! The neighborhood is nice and well-located for seeing Athens and everything you need (grocery, pharmacy, bakery) is a few blocks away.

Maja's friend Julia greeted me very warmly and offered her advice about parts of everyday Athens to see-- not just attractions. It was a very good start to my time there. Thanks to Maja and Julia!"
2423058,35256873,2015-06-16,26991329,Corinna,"Es war absolut großartig! Und für alles gesorgt inklusive Stadtkarten, Reiseführer und Antimücken-Kit. Die Unterkunft ist wirklich wie eine kleine Insel in der Hauptstadt! Wir haben uns seeehr wohl gefühlt und hätten diese Unterkunft am liebsten mit auf unseren Griechenland-Roadtrip mitgenommen :-) Der Kontakt und die Orga war ebenso absolut nett und ausführlich. Wir empfehlen jedem diese Unterkunft in Athen!"
2423058,37744311,2015-07-10,32366268,Thomas,Am Tag unserer Ankunft wurden wir von Julia herzlich empfangen und wurden bestens über Highlights in Athen und im Viertel informiert. Wir fühlten uns in dem Inselhaus ausgesprochen wohl und genossen jeden Abend die Rückkehr dorthin. Der Hof ist ein paradiesischer Ort mitten in der Großstadt. Auch die Wohnumgebung ist angenehm ruhig und hat dennoch Punkte mit Szenecharakter. Möge der altertümliche Charme dieses Hauses Gästen noch lange erhalten bleiben! Viola und Thomas
6781997,36841082,2015-07-01,31308969,Kevin,"Great location. I stayed in a hostel north of omina and my friends and i basically got assaulted by our sleepwalking roommate. Needless to say, we had to book a different room away from there ASAP. I felt bad because of the short notice of this booking, but Dora's son, Hercules, quickly erased all apprehension. Hercules was so awesome as he talked to our cab driver on the phone to explain the directions. He met us outside, took our bags, and showed us up to the apartment. For the next 20 minutes, he explained to us everything about Athens and where we should and shouldn't go. I can't explain how awesome and essential he was. Thank you, Dora and Hercules! P.s. I also love the fact that I have the name ""Hercules"" in my contact list on my phone now."
6457016,34604995,2015-06-09,31685772,Marina,"we loved everything! his apartment is very close To the metro station (max 10 minutes walking). Around his House you can find also cafés, restaurants and supermarket. Its even nicer if you walk To the acropolis and get To know the neighborhood. His terrace gives the best view of the city and the acropolis too, its stunning at night. Besides the great location illias is the best host, always willing To help. his House is gorgeous and very clean. Looking foward To the next trip To athens! "
6457016,34808799,2015-06-12,14843979,Frances,"I had an awesome time staying at Iliais' amazing place. It was really close to the subway station, so easily accessible. The room was huge and the view was stunning! :) Ilias was really hospitable, friendly and helpful. He let me come early as I had an early flight to Athens, and he even came to pick me up from the station with his car!! He was really easy to get along with, and he helped me find my way around Athens with lots of information and by taking me to the Syntagma Square. He respected my privacy and made me feel just like home. I would definitely stay with Ilias again if the place is available when I visit Athens next!! Thanks for the awesome stay, Ilias! Much appreciated. Highly recommended if you want a relaxing space with an amazing view of the Acropolis. "

6457016,37496204,2015-07-07,33727835,Lotus,"Llias is a very nice and helpful host. He told us how to transfer to the nearest metro station and picked us up from the metro station with his car. His English is so good that we can understand him very easily. And his house is great!!! A nice location with a nice view as well as the nice house!!! It's large and beautiful!!! The Acropolis can be seen from balcony!!! It takes us only fifteen minutes to walk to acropolis!!! In a word, it's a amazing experience to live in his house! We do enjoyed the time with him!!!
